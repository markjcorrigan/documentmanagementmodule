Indeed, all humane efforts are barely adequate to compensate for the privilege of waiting on them hand and foot. - You rarely see a cat walking outside of the house with an adult human being, and it can be safely said that no teenager in his or her right mind wants to be seen in public with his or her parents. - Even if you tell jokes as well as Jay Leno, neither your cat nor your teen will ever crack a smile. - No cat or teenager shares you taste in music. - Cats and teenagers can lie on the living-room sofa for hours on end without moving, barely breathing. - Cats have nine lives. Teenagers carry o n as if they did.- Cats and teenagers yawn in exactly the same manner, communicating that ultimate human ecstasy -- a sense of complete and utter boredom. - Cats and teenagers do not improve anyone\'s furniture. - Cats that are free to roam outside sometimes have been known to return in the middle of the night to deposit a dead animal in your bedroom. Teenagers are not above that sort of behavior. Thus, if you must raise teenagers, the best sources of advice are not other parents, but veterinarians. It is also a good idea to keep a guidebook on cats at hand at all times. And remember, above all else, put out the food and do not make any sudden moves in their direction.

God stood over Bill Gates and said, Well Bill, I\'m really confused on this one. It\'s a tough decision; I\'m not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell. After all, you helped society enormously by putting a computer in almost every home in America, yet you also created that ghastly Windows \'95 among other indiscretions. I believe I\'ll do something I\'ve never done before; I\'ll let you decide where you want to go. Bill pushed up his glasses, looked up at God and replied, Could you briefly explain the difference between the two? Looking slightly puzzled, God said, Better yet, why don\'t I let you visit both places briefly, then you can make your decision. Which do you choose to see first, Heaven or Hell? Bill played with his pocket protector for a moment, then looked back at God and said, I think I\'ll try Hell f irst. So, with a flash of lightning and a cloud of smoke, Bill Gates went to Hell. When he materialized in Hell, Bill looked around. It was a beautiful and clean place, a bit warm, with sandy beaches and tall mountains, clear skies, pristine water, and beautiful women frolicking about. A smile came across Bill\'s face as he took in a deep breath of the clean air. This is great, he thought, if this is Hell, I can\'t wait to see heaven. Within seconds of his thought, another flash of lightning and a cloud of smoke appeared, and Bill was off to Heaven. Heaven was a place high above the clouds, where angels were drifting about playing their harps and singing in a beautiful chorus. It was a very nice place, Bill thought, but not as enticing as Hell. Bill looked up, cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled for God and Bill Gates was sent to Hell for eternity. Time passed, and God decided to check on t he late billionaire to see how he was progressing in Hell. When he got there, he found Bill Gates shackled to a wall in a dark cave amid bone thin men and tongues of fire, being burned and tortured by demons. So, how is everything going? God asked. Bill responded with a crackling voice filled with anguish and disappointment, This is awful! It\'s nothing like the Hell I visited the first time!! I can\'t believe this is happening! What happened to the other place.... with the beaches and the mountains and the beautiful women? That was the demo, replied God.', NULL, 0, 0, '2020-12-31 22:00:00', '2021-01-10 15:09:46'),

Her soul arrived up in heaven where she was met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter himself. Welcome to Heaven, said St. Peter. Before you get settled in though it seems we have a problem. You see, strangely enough, we\'ve never once had an accountant make it this far and we\'re not really sure what to do with you. No problem, just let me in. said the accountant. Well, I\'d like to, but I have higher orders. What we\'re going to do is let you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in. Actually, I think I\'ve made up my mind... I prefer to stay in Heaven Sorry, we have rules... And with that St. Peter put the accountant in an elevator and it went down-down-down to hell. The doors opened and the accountant found herself stepping out onto the putting green of a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club and standing in front of her were all her friends - fellow accountants that she had worked with and they were all dressed in evening gowns and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks and they talked about old times. They played an excellent round of golf and at night went to the country club where she enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil who was actually a really nice guy (kinda cute) and she had a great time telling jokes and dancing. The accountant was having such a good time that before she knew it, it was ti me to leave. Everybody shook her hand and waved goodbye as she got on the elevator. The elevator went up-up-up and opened back up at the Pearly Gates and found St. Peter waiting for her. Now it\'s time to spend a day in heaven. So the accountant spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing the harp and singing. She had a great time and before she knew it her 24 hours were up and St. Peter came and got her. So, you\'ve spent a day in hell and you\'ve spent a day in heaven. Now you must choose your eternity. The accountant paused for a second and then replied, Well, I never thought I\'d say this, I mean, Heaven has been really great and all, but I think I had a better time in Hell. So St. Peter escorted her to the elevator and again the accountant went down-down-down back to Hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth.

While they were walking through the barn, during the forced inspection, the farmer\'s mule suddenly reared up and kicked the mother-in-law in the head, killing her instantly. It was a shock to all no matter their feelings toward her demanding ways. At the funeral service a few days later, the farmer stood near the casket and greeted folks as they walked by.

Whenever a man walked by and whispered to the farmer, however, he would shake his head no, and mumble a reply. Very curious as to this bizarre behavior, the pastor later asked the farmer what that was all about.

She hung around and eventually the construction crew - gems in the rough, all of them - more or less adopted her as a kind of project mascot.

The matter was a serious one because the members of the staff of the zoo, while expert at caring for animals, had no experience whatsoever in rounding them up or capturing them. The zoo director appealed to the office of the mayor for help and the secretary to the mayor asked, Have you looked in the yellow pages? The director said he hadn\'t, but would, immediately. To his surprise, under animal capturing service he found a listing for the Acme Ape Apprehenders. He called them immediately. Within 20 minutes, a panel truck arrived at the admin office of the zoo and a small man emerged and rushed to the director who was waiting at the door. Is there a wooded area in the vicinity?, the little man asked. The director said there was, within one half mile from the zoo. Hop in the truck, the little man said. The director did and they drove off. Minutes later they arrived at a small grove and immediately spotted Arnold on a branch about 25 feet above the ground. The two men got out, went to the back of the truck and the little man opened the door. An excited little dog jumped out and began running around in circles. The little man reached into the truck and took out a suitcase, which he opened. In the suitcase were a pair of handcuffs, which he handed to the zoo director, a sawed off shotgun, which he leaned against the trunk of the tree, and a baseball bat. Now, the little man said, I\'m going up into the tree with the baseball bat, and I\'m going to knock the ape out of the tree. The instant the ape hits the ground the dog, well trained, will bite the ape by the crotch and chomp-down with his jaws. The ape will, instantly and instinctively, grab at his crotch with both hands due to the pain, and you snap the handcuffs on and we\'ve got him. The zoo director, pointing to the shotgun leaning against the tree, said I\'m not too sure about this -- what\'s the gun for? The little man said, Look, I\'m an expert.

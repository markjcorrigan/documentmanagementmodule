But there are six of them here. What gives?<br />				<br />				A: Some project managers focus on Cost, Scope, and Time as the				main constraints of a project. But just thinking about those				three constraints doesn&#8217;t give a clear picture of all of the				constraints you need to account for when planning a project. The				important thing here is to understand that Cost, Time, Scope,				Quality, Risk, and Resources are all related to each other. You				need to pay attention to all of them and if you manage your				project in favor of one of them, it will affect the others.<br />				<br />				Q: I&#8217;ve heard of an old saying: &#8220;Faster, cheaper, better&#8212;pick				two,&#8221; but doesn&#8217;t that mean that there are only two constraints				that you can manage at any given time?<br />				<br />				A: No, that&#8217;s an old (and somewhat cynical) project management				saying. When a project manager says it to a customer or				stakeholder, what he is saying is that there&#8217;s no way to reduce				cost, shorten the schedule, and increase quality all at the same				time. At least one of those things absolutely has to give&#8230; but				the saying is a little disingenuous! We already know that all				six of the constraints are related to each other, and there&#8217;s				almost never an easy, obvious trade-off where you can sacrifice				one to improve the others.<br />				<br />				The delivery gap isdefined as the part of the                project between the start of the EXECUTE STAGE, through                the STABILIZE STAGE (internal and external testing etc.), to deployment (rollout)				andfinally                ending up at sign off of the delivery of a successful project and project				CLOSE STAGE.&nbsp;				<br />				<br />				It is				when moving across                this gap that the project must have &quot;scope locked                down&quot;.&nbsp;				In <a href="/epms.php" >				EPMS</a> terms this means we have a project schedule with				resources allocated and tasked to this schedule and it is				baselined!&nbsp; Remember the baselined project schedule is your				plan of how to safely jump the project delivery gap!&nbsp; The				schedule is also your				<a href="/irontriangle.php" >				IRON TRIANGLE</a>!</p><p>The important point is that at CMMi Level 1. the				vital importance of this is				not fully understood or accepted as the focus is to &quot;<strong><a href="/cmm.php#justdoit" >JUST DO				IT</a></strong>&quot;, get on with it a.s.a.p. and start delivering.<br />				While CMMi Level 2. is all about				proper planning to ensure that, as a project				<a href="/team.php" >TEAM</a>, &quot;<strong><a href="/cmmi.php#diag" >WE ARE READY TO DO IT</a></strong>&quot;				before we start to jump across the gap.</p>				<hr />				<h3 class="auto-style3">Project Charters are typically created at the start of a				project (INITIATE STAGE), <br />				however PMWay suggests a lateral approach in the use of the				Project Charter <br />				(to more successfully define,&nbsp;manage and				jump gaps) <br />				this &quot;tactic&quot; as a strategic driver for success is more fully				explained <br />				if you click the &quot;Show&quot; button directly below.</h3>                		<a name="topofnav6"></a>				&nbsp;<section class="round-border">		<h2><button href="#collapse9" class="nav-toggle">Show</button>&nbsp;Lateral thinking to use the Project Charter to successfully Jump Gaps!</h2>		<div id="collapse9" style="display:none" class="auto-style15">				<p>Note:  This is dealt with in depth in the				<a href="/charter.php" >Charter page of PMWay</a>.  However here is the essence:<br><br>PMWay uses the <strong>&quot;"signed off" Appointment of a Project Manager				form&quot;</strong> to officially appoint the Project Manager to run the				project.

        Understanding Through Everyday Examples
    </h2>

    <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        A bottle is a perfect example of freedoms, barriers and goals in harmony. Consider a bottle of beer: utilizing freedoms, barriers and goals, the bottle can be bought as one of six in a six pack, stored in a fridge or pantry, and eventually used to pour the beer in a glass, or to drink the beer directly from the bottle.

        If you think carefully about it, the PMBOK Dashboard (or other project method) is also reliant on the concept of freedoms, barriers and goals.

        The Journey from Infancy to Reality
    </h3>

    <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        When you were a baby you had no barriers. In Psychology we would say that you had no ego boundaries. When you were hungry, you cried and you were fed. When you were cold, you cried and were wrapped up in a warm blanket. When you were wet, you cried and were changed and cuddled and everything was made warm and right again.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        As you grew up life started to bump into you and started to push your ego boundaries back into place. Your ego boundaries snapped back from a (fantasy) position where you thought there were no barriers at all, to being in a more realistic place which is aligned with the real world.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Living in the real world should not be about the fantasy of total freedom, but rather a realization of real freedoms earned within barriers. The transition from total freedom to freedom within barriers was learned (started to happen to you) when, for example, you started to walk as a baby and then bumped into a table and felt pain. Oops... something painful stopping me and is in my way! Possibly if I go around the table by moving like this.... Or you had a temper tantrum and demanded something that your parents suddenly did not give you. Or someone at play school started screaming because you took their toy away from them and the teacher reprimanded you.

        When Balance is Lost: Examples of Imbalance
    </h3>

    <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        An example of behavior without barriers could be an older child that is never disciplined and can do whatever it wants—the child is growing up and is not being taught the importance of barriers or boundaries.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Or a teenager who has not moved out of the unrealistic mindset of total freedom and who is extremely lazy and who wants to live a constant life of freedoms—without barriers or goals (the self discipline needed to achieve goals).
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        A drug addict is another more extreme example of this type of person who wants total freedom all the time and (because they cannot put into place the necessary barriers or have not put goals into place within the barriers needed to achieve them) actually wants to escape totally from the rigors of life into a world that is constructed by a pain relieving drug induced haze.

        The word "NO" can be a positive word that puts boundaries back into place and teaches us how to live within constraints while interacting constructively with each other and in groups.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        The word "Respect" is a word that shows that you have an understanding of and respect for the boundaries of others—their privacy, their possessions, and so on.

        The Economic Reality: Scarcity and Competition
    </h2>

    <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        If this were a utopian world, and we could all get everything we wanted, whenever we wanted, then unrealistic expectations (now made realistic because of utopia) would never be a problem. But the fact is that we all live in a physical world where there are laws of nature (the economic laws of scarcity) and as such there is also fierce competition for resources. In looking for work (jobs) there is also competition for successful lucrative positions.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Economists refer to this as having a "multiplicity of wants" and trying to satisfy these wants with "scarce resources." Resources are broadly categorized into:

        The Golden Goose: A Timeless Lesson
    </h3>

    <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        The old story of the golden goose which lays a single golden egg each day remains relevant and true. Being greedy, the recipient of the regular golden egg may decide that it would be better if the head of the goose is chopped off to find all of the eggs (more eggs) at once! But with this comes the demise of the goose and the end of the golden eggs! This is also an example of the misuse and misunderstanding of how to keep Freedoms, Barriers and Goals in balance.

    <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        The existence of too many barriers can also be a problem as this can force a person into overwhelm where they do not think that they can succeed and can, as a result, give up and stop pushing for success altogether (called a "blow" condition where they suddenly up and leave, refusing to play the game any longer).

        Or someone who works all the time (overcoming one barrier after the next) and as such has no time left for their spouse or family—they are too rigid and have surrounded themselves with too many goals, enforcing the barriers necessary to obtain them (staying at work until late each night) and has few freedoms. What normally happens with this type of person is that suddenly, one day, they meet someone at work and have a wonderful affair (their ego boundaries collapse and they become like children again with no cares or responsibilities) but then they wake up later, as their ego boundaries snap back into place and realize the disastrous consequences of their actions, after their family has disintegrated into the devastation of divorce.

        Barriers can also be used to play games—withholding information, undermining, blocking initiative.

		<h2><button href="#collapse1" class="nav-toggle">Show</button>&nbsp;Project Statement of Work</h2>
		<div id="collapse1" style="display:none" class="auto-style4">
			<p>The Project Statement of Work is an input to the 4.1 Develop Project
	Charter process in the Initiating Process Group. <br />
	The output of that process is the Project Charter.<br />
	<br />
	Working through information below should make the distinction between the
	Project Statement of Work (SOW) and the Project Charter more clear. <br />
	<br />
	We will do this by answering the questions: <br />
	1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#1">What is it?</a> <br />
	2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#2">How does it fit in the flow of PM
	processes?</a> <br />
	3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#3">Who creates it? </a><br />
	4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#4">What’s in it? </a><br />
	5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#5">How does it compare to the Project
	Charter?</a> <br />
	<br />
	<a name="1"></a>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Project Statement of Work (SOW)—What is
	it?<br />
	<br />
	The best way to describe the Project Statement of Work is as the “seed” of
	the project. <br />
	It is watered during the Initiating Process into the Project Charter which
	causes it to germinate and become a seedling. The seedling is planted in the
	ground during the Planning process of creating the Project Scope Statement.
	It then turns into a plant during the Executing Process (where it is given
	sunlight and water, analogous to project resources) and Monitoring &amp;
	Controlling Process (where it is checked periodically to see if there are
	any adverse conditions such as pests or diseases), and is finally harvested
	at the time of the Closing Process.<br />
	<br />
	<a name="2"></a>2. Project Statement of Work (SOW)—How does it fit into the
	flow of PM Processes?<br />
	<br />
	The SOW is the seed or kernel of the idea for the project which is then
	developed at a high level for the purpose of approval of the project during
	the Initiating Process Group as process 4.1, Develop Project Charter. <br />
	<br />
	The Project Charter, if approved, is developed at a higher level of detail
	in the Planning Process Group as process 5.3, Define Scope. So here’s the
	flow of how the documents are connected:<br />
	<br />
	<img alt="" height="292" src="http://www.pmway.co.za/processesdash/images/sowcharter.PNG" width="487" /><br />
	<br />
	<a name="3"></a>3. Project Statement of Work (SOW)—Who creates it?<br />
	<br />
	This is going to depend on if the end result of the project is going to be a
	product, service, or result that is used internally within the company, or
	is to be delivered to an external customer.<br />
	If the sponsoring organization is the one that is going to use the end
	result, then the sponsor is the one that originates the SOW. If a customer
	is the one that is going to use the end result, then the customer is the one
	that originates the SOW. The SOW may be part of a bid document (request for
	proposal, request for information, request for bid) or as part of a
	contract.<br />
	<br />
	<a name="4"></a>4. Project Statement of Work (SOW)—What’s in it?<br />
	<br />
	The PMBOK® Guide references 5 inputs to the 4.1 Develop Project Charter
	process, two of which are the generic Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEF)
	and the Organizational Process Assets (OPA), the “company culture” and
	“company processes” that are inputs to many PM processes. The other three
	are the Project Statement of Work, the Business Case, and Agreements.</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="" height="313" src="http://www.pmway.co.za/processesdash/images/sowbc.PNG" width="487" /></p>
	<p>However, listing these three like this is somewhat misleading and obscures
	their interrelationships. <br />
	Here are more detailed descriptions of these three inputs:<br />
	<br />
	a. SOW<br />
	The components of the Project SOW are as follows:<br />
	<br />
	<img alt="" height="385" src="http://www.pmway.co.za/processesdash/images/element.PNG" width="469" /><br />
	<br />
	b. Business Case<br />
	<br />
	How is the business need different from the business case? The business case
	takes the business need outlined in the SOW (element 1 in the chart above)
	and justifies how the result of the project (element 2 in the chart above)
	will satisfy that need AND align with the strategic goals of the
	organization (element 3 in the chart above). It is the analysis that ties
	together the 3 elements of the SOW like so:</p>
	<p><img alt="" height="301" src="http://www.pmway.co.za/processesdash/images/bc.PNG" width="486" /></p>
	<p>c. Agreements<br />
	As mentioned above, IF the product is to be made for a customer, then the
	SOW may come from the contract, a memorandum of understanding (MOU), a
	letter of intent, or some other form. The key is that the statement of work
	may come either internally (from the sponsor) or externally (from the
	customer).<br />
	I hope this explanation clears up the distinction between these three inputs
	of the process 4.1 Develop Project Charter other than the generic EEFs and
	OPAs.<br />
	<br />
	<a name="5"></a>5. Project Statement of Work: How does it Compare to the
	Project Charter?<br />
	Here are the elements of the Project Statement of Work (the “seed” idea of
	the project) compared to the elements of the Project Charter (used for
	approval of the project). Those elements which are similar are put in the
	same row. In this chart, the elements 1 and 3 from the above chart on the
	Project Statement of Work correspond to the first element of the Project
	Charter, and element 2 from the above chart corresponds to the second
	element of the Project Charter.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	<img alt="" height="305" src="http://www.pmway.co.za/processesdash/images/sow.PNG" width="468" /></p>
	<p>The Project Statement of Work is therefore the core of the first two
	elements of the Project Charter.<br />
	The other elements of the project charter deal with the project scope rather
	than the product scope (Project assumptions, constraints, high-level
	descriptions, boundaries), the criteria for success and those risks that may
	prevent the project from being successful, the high-level constraints of
	time and cost, the stakeholder list, the project approval requirements and
	authority, and finally, the actual project manager assigned to the project.</p>

how your company does business.
</h2><p>There’s a lot of information about your company that will be really
useful to you when you’re planning your project. You need to know
how each of the different departments operates, the market conditions
you’re working in, the company’s overall strategy, any policies you
need to work with, your company’s culture, and all about the people
who work at the company.</p>
<p>One of the enterprise environmental factors you’ll use in the
Integration Management processes is the work authorization
system, which determines how your company assigns work to people
and ensures that tasks are done properly and in the right order.</p>

			<img alt="" height="382" src="http://www.pmway.co.za/processesdash/images/eye_process_diagram.jpg" width="425" /><p>Every company has standards for how to run its projects. There are
guidelines and instructions for managing projects, procedures you
need to follow, categories for various things you need to keep track of,
and templates for all of the various documents that you need to create.
These things are usually stored in some sort of library.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pmway.co.za/uml.html#starthere" >Click here</a> for a process that uses the Microsoft Enterprise Project Server to manage project documents.<br />The process is found towards the bottom of the section [Why "process design" is the glue - in a nutshell]
			</p>

<p>One of the most important organizational process assets is called
lessons learned, which is how you keep track of valuable historical
information about your project. At the end of every project, you sit
down with the project team and write down everything you learned
about the project. This includes both positive and negative things.
That way, when you or another project manager in your company
plans the next project, you can take advantage of the lessons you
learned on this one.</p><div class="left"><a href="#topofbox4"><span class="smltxt">Return to top of pop

<h2>Expert Judgement and the assistance of SME's (Subject Matter Experts)</h2>


<p>When you think about it, a lot of different people’s opinions can help your company
come to a good decision about whether or not to start a project. Sometimes project
sponsors will call on experts or subject matter experts to help them decide which projects to do and for expertise required when running them.

Your company might need to talk to subject matter experts from a bunch of
different departments to decide if a project will be beneficial to it. It might rely on
outside consultants or industry groups to tell it how other companies have solved
the same problem. All of those different opinions are called expert judgment.
If the experts agree that the project’s business case, contract, and statement of
work all add up to a product that’s going to do good things for your company,
they’ll usually give the green light to write the charter.</p>

<img alt="TEAM" height="978" src="http://www.pmway.co.za/images/Func.png" width="750">

<h2>Facilitation techniques help everyone understand
the goal of your project</h2>

<p>When you sit down to write your project charter, you’ll need to
get your stakeholders on the same page about what your project
team will do. You might set up meetings with your stakeholders
to brainstorm project goals or work with them to resolve conflicts
around how your project will run. All of the approaches you
take to get everybody on the same page are called facilitation
techniques.</p>

		<p>		<img alt="project charter" height="392" src="http://www.pmway.co.za/processesdash/images/project-charter.jpg" style="border: 0px; max-width: 100%; height: auto; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 15px; display: inline;" title="project charter" width="261" />The
		Project Charter is the first official document that answers the
		question, “When does a project start?”</p>
		<p>		“A project starts officially when the project charter is created and
		signed-off by the project sponsor or anyone from the top management
		authorized to do so.”</p>
		<p>The signed Project Charter also authorises the Project Manager to run the project and to use company resources.</p>
		<p>		The Project charter is also known as a&nbsp;Project Definition Document.</p>

		<p>		If you go through the second paragraph, it says that — a project starts
		officially when the project charter is created…</p>
		<p>		Now you may ask:</p>
		<ul style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px;">
			<li style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 30px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; list-style-type: disc;" class="auto-style2">
			What it meant by “Officially Starting” the project?</li>
			<li style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 30px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; list-style-type: disc;" class="auto-style2">
			Why did we simply not say that “A project starts when the project
			charter is created…”</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There is a difference between the “starting of the project” and
		“officially starting of the project.”</p>
		<p>		A project may start when the project sponsor just thought of it, or some
		of his friends gave him an idea about it, or the night he dreamed of it.
		There may be some other starting points as well. Think of them…</p>
		<p>		Afterwards, he may give serious considerations to those ideas. He
		discusses it with his friends and applies cost benefit analysis to see
		if it is really profitable to go for it, or if he should just leave it.</p>
		<p>		Once he makes the decision to go ahead with it, he will call someone
		(project manager) to lead his project and some other people to work with
		him.</p>
		<p>		Then he will create the project charter (or he may ask the project
		manager to create the project charter to authorize the project
		officially), and gives the project manager authority to lead and
		complete the project.</p>
		<p>		The moment the project sponsor signs the project charter, the project
		starts officially.</p>
		<p>		As per the PMBOK Guide, the project charter is an<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><em>official&nbsp;document
		that formally authorizes a project or a phase and documenting initial
		requirements that satisfies stakeholders’ need and expectation</em>.</p>
		<p>		A project charter documents the business need or demand that causes the
		project’s existence, and includes a short description of the product,
		service, or the result of the project.</p>
		<h1 class="auto-style2">Characteristics of the Project Charter</h1>
		<p>		Following are the few characteristics of the Project Charter:</p>
		<ul style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px;">

			It must be signed by the project sponsor or someone from top
			management (external to the project)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>		Please note that the project charter may be created by the project
		manager, but it must be authorized by someone external to the project,
		as it is very obvious that how a project manager can authorize himself
		as a project manager.</p>
		<p>		The project manager may create a project charter, or provide the input
		to create it, but only top management has authority to sign it.</p>
		<p>		In the creation of the project charter, help from the project manager is
		required because he is the one who will be leading the project and knows
		about the project methodologies.</p>
		<p>		The project charter should be created as soon as possible because if
		there is no project charter, there will be no project manager, no
		project title, and consequently a cost account cannot be opened to log
		the cost of the project.</p>
		<p>		A project charter is a very important document, and it is very rare to
		make amendments or changes in it.</p>
		<p>		A project charter contains the information such as:</p>
		<ul style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 20px;">

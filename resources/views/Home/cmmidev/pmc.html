					<br />
					<br />
					<center><b>Purpose</b> </center><br />
					<br />
					The purpose of Project Monitoring and Control (PMC) is to 
					provide an understanding of the project’s progress so that 
					appropriate corrective actions can be taken when the 
					project’s performance deviates significantly from the plan.
					<br />
					<br />
					<center><b>Introductory Notes </b></center><br />
					<br />
					A project’s documented plan is the basis for monitoring 
					activities, communicating status, and taking corrective 
					action. Progress is primarily determined by comparing actual 
					work product and task attributes, effort, cost, and schedule 
					to the plan at prescribed milestones or control levels 
					within the project schedule or work breakdown structure 
					(WBS). Appropriate visibility enables timely corrective 
					action to be taken when performance deviates significantly 
					from the plan. A deviation is significant if, when left 
					unresolved, it precludes the project from meeting its 
					objectives. <br />
					<br />
					The term “project plan” is used throughout these practices 
					to refer to the overall plan for controlling the project.
					<br />
					<br />
					When actual status deviates significantly from the expected 
					values, corrective actions are taken as appropriate. These 
					actions may require replanning, which may include revising 
					the original plan, establishing new agreements, or including 
					additional mitigation activities within the current plan.
					<br />
					<br />
					<b>Related Process Areas.</b> <br />
					<br />
					Refer to the Project Planning process area for more 
					information about the project plan, including how it 
					specifies the appropriate level of project monitoring, the 
					measures used to monitor progress, and known risks. <br />
					<br />
					Refer to the Measurement and Analysis process area for 
					information about the process of measuring, analyzing, and 
					recording information. <br />

					<a name="sgp"></a><b>Specific Practices by Goal</b> <br />
					<br />
					<a name="sg1"></a><b>SG 1 Monitor Project Against Plan</b>
					<br />
					<br />
					Actual performance and progress of the project are monitored 
					against the project plan. <br />
					<br />
					<a name="sp11"></a><b>SP 1.1 Monitor Project 
					Planning Parameters</b> <br />
					<br />
					Monitor the actual values of the project planning parameters 
					against the project plan. <br />
					<br />
					Project planning parameters constitute typical indicators of 
					project progress and performance and include attributes of 
					work products and tasks, cost, effort, and schedule. 
					Attributes of the work products and tasks include such items 
					as size, complexity, weight, form, fit, or function. <br />
					<br />
					Monitoring typically involves measuring the actual values of 
					project planning parameters, comparing actual values to the 
					estimates in the plan, and identifying significant 
					deviations. Recording actual values of the project planning 
					parameters includes recording associated contextual 
					information to help understand the measures. An analysis of 
					the impact that significant deviations have on determining 
					what corrective actions to take is handled in the second 
					specific goal and its specific practices in this process 
					area. <br />

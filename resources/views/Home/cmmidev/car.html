					<td><p>Causal analysis and resolution is one of the center pillars 
					of Software Process Improvement. Without tracing defects to 
					their root cause there is no opportunity to reduce (or 
					eliminate) those defects. Key to Causal Analysis is Product 
					Quality Assurance (Software Quality Assurance) which 
					establishes process descriptions, standards, and procedures 
					and then checks for <i>noncompliance</i> issues against 
					those documented standards and procedures. Identification of 
					defects provides initial input to Casual analysis as does an 
					ongoing
					<a href="http://www.sqa.net/softwarequalitymetrics.php">
					Software Metrics</a> (measurements) program, implemented as 
					Measurement and Analysis (MA) under CMMi. <br />
					<br />
					Under CMMi for Software Development the following 3 Process 
					Areas form the backbone for a Software Process Improvement 
					framework:</p> 
					<ul>
					<li>Process and Product Quality Assurance (PPQA) </li>
					<li>Measurement and Analysis (MA) </li>
					<li>Causal Analysis and Resolution (CAR) </li></ul>
					<p><b>Causal analysis is, however, a science and an art</b>. 
					There is an old saying that is applicable to Casual Analysis 
					and it goes:- <br />
					<br />
					<b>It ain't what you don't know that hurts you, it is what 
					you know that ain't so.</b> <br />
					<br />
					Basically Causal Analysis is the result of deep analytical 
					(and possibly experimental) research which is often 
					initiated by hunches or experience. <br />
					Casual Analysis can be broken into two phases: </p>
					<ul>
					<li>Macro problem identification. </li>
					<li>Micro problem identification. </li>
					</ul>
					<p>
					<b>Macro problem identification</b> uses tools such as
					<a href="http://quality.enr.state.nc.us/tools/fishbone.htm">
					Cause-and-effect (fishbone) diagrams</a>, this tool will 
					scope the cause to a number of possibilities. This tool, and 
					other similar tools, are only identifying <i>possibilities</i> 
					and typically look at: </p>
					<ul>
					
					<li>The 4 M's - Methods, Machines, Materials, Manpower. </li>
					<li>The 4 P's - Place, Procedure, People, Policies . </li>
					<li>The 4 S's - Surroundings, Suppliers, Systems, Skills.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
					Once <b>possibilities</b> have been identified (and this is 
					usually based on experience and hunches) then the <b>Micro 
					problem identification</b> can begin. <br />
					Micro problem identification attempts to pin point the 
					cause, or at least one cause, to a level that can be 
					addressed. <br />
					<br />
					For this stage of problem identification a <i>Hypothesis</i> 
					or assumption is formed and then tested. <br />
					For example Software Supportability can be measured by <i>
					mean time to repair MTTR</i>, one cause on high MTTR would 
					be code that is difficult to read. Since code complexity 
					itself can be measured (see
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cyclomatic_complexity">
					Cyclomatic complexity</a>) it is possible to test the 
					assumption (lower code complexity will yield lower MTTR) of 
					the cause for high Support costs. <br />
					In this way coding standards could be introduced and their 
					effects measured to verify a cause for high MTTR. <br />
					<br />
					In the above example <i>experiments</i> could also be 
					conducted using sample code (containing defects). In this 
					way two sets of programmers would be shown either structured 
					(less complicated) code or unstructured (more complicated) 
					code containing the same defect. Then the time taken to find 
					the defect could be determined. This information could prove 
					the assumption being tested, to identify a cause of the 
					problem. <br />
					<br />
					Such experiments may or may not 
					be practical in all situations but they underline the points 
					of:</p> 
					<ul>
					<li>Proving an assumption via experimentation, to pin point 
					a cause of a given defect. </li>
					<li>Identifying the correct metric (measurement) that 
					quantifies the presence of the defect. </li>
					<li>Only examining one variable, on the cause of the defect, 
					at a time. </li>
					</ul>
					<p>It is noted that all CMMI Process Areas are subjected to 
					Root Cause Analysis, in order to achieve capability rating 
					of level 5. <br />
					Also Root Cause Analysis is the foundation of any Software 
					Process Improvement framework (not just CMMi). <br />

					<br />
					<b>Purpose</b> <br />
					<br />
					The purpose of Causal Analysis and Resolution (CAR) is to 
					identify causes of defects and other problems and take 
					action to prevent them from occurring in the future. <br />
					<br />
					<b>Introductory Notes </b><br>The Causal 
					Analysis and Resolution process area involves the following:
					<br />
					<br />
					<li>Identifying and analyzing causes of defects and other 
					problems </li>
					<li>Taking specific actions to remove the causes and prevent 
					the occurrence of those types of defects and problems in the 
					future <br />
					<br />
					Causal analysis and resolution improves quality and 
					productivity by preventing the introduction of defects into 
					a product. Reliance on detecting defects after they have 
					been introduced is not cost effective. It is more effective 
					to prevent defects from being introduced by integrating 
					causal analysis and resolution activities into each phase of 
					the project. Since defects and problems may have been 
					previously encountered on other projects or in earlier 
					phases or tasks of the current project, causal analysis and 
					resolution activities are a mechanism for communicating 
					lessons learned among projects. The types of defects and 
					other problems encountered are analyzed to identify any 
					trends. Based on an understanding of the defined process and 
					how it is implemented, the root causes of the defects and 
					the future implications of the defects are determined. 
					Causal analysis may also be performed on problems unrelated 
					to defects. For example, causal analysis may be used to 
					improve quality attributes such as cycle time. Improvement 
					proposals, simulations, dynamic systems models, engineering 
					analyses, new business directives, or other items may 
					initiate such analysis. When it is impractical to perform 
					causal analysis on all defects, defect targets are selected 
					by tradeoffs on estimated investments and estimated returns 
					of quality, productivity and cycle time. A measurement 
					process should already be in place. The defined measures can 
					be used, though in some instances new measures may be needed 
					to analyze the effects of the process change. Refer to the 
					Measurement and Analysis process area for more information 
					about establishing objectives for measurement and analysis, 
					specifying the measures and analyses to be performed, 
					obtaining and analyzing measures, and reporting results. 
					Causal Analysis and Resolution activities provide a 
					mechanism for projects to evaluate their processes at the 
					local level and look for improvements that can be 
					implemented. When improvements are judged to be effective, 
					the information is extended to the organizational level. 
					Refer to the Organizational Innovation and Deployment 
					process area for more information about improving 
					organizational level processes through proposed improvements 
					and action proposals. The informative material in this 
					process area is written with the assumption that the 
					specific practices are applied to a quantitatively managed 
					process. The specific practices of this process area may be 
					applicable, but with reduced value, if this assumption is 
					not met. See the definitions of â€œstable processâ€ and â€œcommon 
					cause of process variationâ€ in the glossary. <br />

					<br />
					<br />
					Perform causal analysis of selected defects and other 
					problems and propose actions to address them. <br />
					<br />
					The purpose of this analysis is to develop solutions to the 
					identified problems by analyzing the relevant data and 
					producing action proposals for implementation. <br />
					Typical Work Products <br />
					Action proposal <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 1: Conduct causal analysis with the people who 
					are responsible for performing the task. <br />
					<br />
					Causal analysis is performed, typically in meetings, with 
					those people who have an understanding of the selected 
					defect or problem under study. The people who have the best 
					understanding of the selected defect are typically those 
					responsible for performing the task. <br />
					<br />
					Examples of when to perform causal analysis include the 
					following: <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>When a stable process does not meet its specified 
					quality and process-performance objectives </li>
					<li>During the task, if and when problems warrant a causal 
					analysis meeting </li>
					<li>When a work product exhibits an unexpected deviation 
					from its requirements <br />
					<br />
					<i>Refer to the Quantitative Project Management process area 
					for more information about achieving the projectâ€™s quality 
					and process-performance objectives. </i><br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 2: Analyze selected defects and other problems 
					to determine their root causes. <br />
					<br />
					Depending on the type and number of defects, it may make 
					sense to first group the defects before identifying their 
					root causes. <br />
					<br />
					Examples of methods to determine root causes include the 
					following: </li>
					<li>Cause-and-effect (fishbone) diagrams </li>
					<li>Check sheets <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 3: Group the selected defects and other problems 
					based on their root causes. <br />
					<br />
					Examples of cause groups, or categories, include the 
					following: <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Inadequate training </li>
					<li>Breakdown of communications </li>
					<li>Not accounting for all details of a task </li>
					<li>Making mistakes in manual procedures (e.g., typing) </li>
					<li>Process deficiency <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 4: Propose and document actions that need to be 
					taken to prevent the future occurrence of similar defects or 
					other problems. <br />
					<br />
					Examples of proposed actions include changes to the 
					following: <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>The process in question </li>
					<li>Training </li>
					<li>Tools </li>
					<li>Methods </li>
					<li>Communications </li>
					<li>Work products <br />
					<br />
					Examples of specific actions include the following: <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Providing training in common problems and techniques for 
					preventing them </li>
					<li>Changing a process so that error-prone steps do not 
					occur </li>
					<li>Automating all or part of a process </li>
					<li>Reordering process activities </li>
					<li>Adding process steps to prevent defects, such as task 
					kickoff meetings to review common defects and actions to 
					prevent them <br />
					<br />
					An action proposal usually documents the following: <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Originator of the action proposal </li>
					<li>Description of the problem </li>
					<li>Description of the defect cause </li>
					<li>Defect cause category </li>
					<li>Phase when the problem was introduced </li>
					<li>Phase when the defect was identified </li>
					<li>Description of the action proposal </li>
					<li>Action proposal category <br />

					<a name="sgtwo"></a><b>SG 2 Address Causes of Defects</b>
					<br />
					Root causes of defects and other problems are systematically 
					addressed to prevent their future occurrence. <br />
					<br />
					Projects operating according to a well-defined process will 
					systematically analyze the operation where problems still 
					occur and implement process changes to eliminate root causes 
					of selected problems. <br />
					<br />
					<a name="sptwoone"></a><b>SP 2.1 Implement the Action Proposals</b>
					<br />
					<br />
					Implement the selected action proposals that were developed 
					in causal analysis. <br />
					<br />
					Action proposals describe the tasks necessary to remove the 
					root causes of the analyzed defects or problems and avoid 
					their reoccurrence. <br />
					<br />
					Only changes that prove to be of value should be considered 
					for broad implementation. <br />
					Typical Work Products <br />
					</li>
					<li>Action proposals selected for implementation </li>
					<li>Improvement proposals <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 1: Analyze the action proposals and determine 
					their priorities. <br />
					<br />
					Criteria for prioritizing action proposals include the 
					following: <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Implications of not addressing the defects </li>
					<li>Cost to implement process improvements to prevent the 
					defects </li>
					<li>Expected impact on quality <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 2: Select the action proposals that will be 
					implemented. <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 3: Create action items for implementing the 
					action proposals. <br />
					<br />
					Examples of information provided in an action item include 
					the following: <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Person responsible for implementing it </li>
					<li>Description of the areas affected by it </li>
					<li>People who are to be kept informed of its status </li>
					<li>Next date that status will be reviewed </li>
					<li>Rationale for key decisions </li>
					<li>Description of implementation actions </li>
					<li>Time and cost for identifying the defect and correcting 
					it </li>
					<li>Estimated cost of not fixing the problem <br />
					<br />
					To implement the action proposals, the following tasks must 
					be done: <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Make assignments </li>
					<li>Coordinate the persons doing the work </li>
					<li>Review the results </li>
					<li>Track the action items to closure <br />
					<br />
					Experiments may be conducted for particularly complex 
					changes. <br />
					<br />
					Examples of experiments include the following: <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Using a temporarily modified process </li>
					<li>Using a new tool <br />
					<br />
					Action items may be assigned to members of the causal 
					analysis team, members of the project team, or other members 
					of the organization. <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 4: Identify and remove similar defects that may 
					exist in other processes and work products. <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 5: Identify and document improvement proposals 
					for the organizationâ€™s set of standard processes. <br />
					<br />
					Refer to the Organizational Innovation and Deployment 
					process area for more information about the selection and 
					deployment of improvement proposals for the organizationâ€™s 
					set of standard processes. <br />
					<br />
					<a name="sptwotwo"></a><b>SP 2.2 Evaluate the Effect of Changes</b>
					<br />
					<br />
					Evaluate the effect of changes on process performance. <br />
					<br />
					Refer to the Quantitative Project Management process area 
					for more information about analyzing process performance and 
					creating process capability measures for selected processes.
					<br />
					<br />
					Once the changed process is deployed across the project, the 
					effect of the changes must be checked to gather evidence 
					that the process change has corrected the problem and 
					improved performance. <br />
					<br />
					Typical Work Products <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Measures of performance and performance change <br />
					<br />
					Subpractices 1: Measure the change in the performance of the 
					project's defined process as appropriate. <br />
					<br />
					This subpractice determines whether the selected change has 
					positively influenced the process performance and by how 
					much. <br />
					<br />
					An example of a change in the performance of the projectâ€™s 
					defined design process would be the change in the defect 
					density of the design documentation, as statistically 
					measured through peer reviews before and after the 
					improvement has been made. On a statistical process control 
					chart, this would be represented by a change in the mean.
					<br />
					<br />
					Subpractices 2: Measure the capability of the project's 
					defined process as appropriate. <br />
					<br />
					This subpractice determines whether the selected change has 
					positively influenced the ability of the process to meet its 
					quality and process-performance objectives, as determined by 
					relevant stakeholders. <br />
					<br />
					An example of a change in the capability of the projectâ€™s 
					defined design process would be a change in the ability of 
					the process to stay within its process-specification 
					boundaries. This can be statistically measured by 
					calculating the range of the defect density of design 
					documentation, as collected in peer reviews before and after 
					the improvement has been made. On a statistical process 
					control chart, this would be represented by lowered control 
					limits. <br />

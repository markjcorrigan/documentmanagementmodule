					Process Area at Maturity Level 2</b> <br />
					<br />
					<center><b>Purpose</b> </center><br />
					The purpose of Project Planning (PP) is to establish and 
					maintain plans that define project activities. <br />
					<br />
					<center><b>Introductory Notes </b></center><br />
					The Project Planning process area involves the following:
					<br />
					<br />
					<li>Developing the project plan </li>
					<li>Interacting with stakeholders appropriately </li>
					<li>Getting commitment to the plan </li>
					<li>Maintaining the plan <br />
					<br />
					Planning begins with requirements that define the product 
					and project. <br />
					<br />
					Planning includes estimating the attributes of the work 
					products and tasks, determining the resources needed, 
					negotiating commitments, producing a schedule, and 
					identifying and analyzing project risks. Iterating through 
					these activities may be necessary to establish the project 
					plan. The project plan provides the basis for performing and 
					controlling the project’s activities that address the 
					commitments with the project’s customer. <br />
					<br />
					The project plan will usually need to be revised as the 
					project progresses to address changes in requirements and 
					commitments, inaccurate estimates, corrective actions, and 
					process changes. Specific practices describing both planning 
					and replanning are contained in this process area. <br />
					<br />
					The term “project plan” is used throughout the generic and 
					specific practices in this process area to refer to the 
					overall plan for controlling the project. <br />
					<br />
					Related Process Areas <br />
					<br />
					Refer to the Requirements Development process area for more 
					information about developing requirements that define the 
					product and product components. Product and product 
					component requirements and changes to those requirements 
					serve as a basis for planning and replanning. <br />
					<br />
					Refer to the Requirements Management process area for more 
					information about managing requirements needed for planning 
					and replanning. <br />
					<br />
					Refer to the Risk Management process area for more 
					information about identifying and managing risks. <br />
					<br />
					Refer to the Technical Solution process area for more 
					information about transforming requirements into product and 
					product component solutions. <br />
					<br />
					<a name="sgp"></a><b>Specific Practices by Goal</b> <br />
					<br />
					<a name="sg1"></a><b>SG 1 Establish Estimates</b> <br />
					<br />
					Estimates of project planning parameters are established and 
					maintained. <br />
					<br />
					Project planning parameters include all information needed 
					by the project to perform the necessary planning, 
					organizing, staffing, directing, coordinating, reporting, 
					and budgeting. <br />
					<br />
					Estimates of planning parameters should have a sound basis 
					to instill confidence that any plans based on these 
					estimates are capable of supporting project objectives.
					<br />
					<br />
					Factors that are typically considered when estimating these 
					parameters include the following: <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Project requirements, including the product 
					requirements, the requirements imposed by the organization, 
					the requirements imposed by the customer, and other 
					requirements that impact the project </li>
					<li>Scope of the project </li>
					<li>Identified tasks and work products </li>
					<li>Technical approach </li>
					<li>Selected project lifecycle model (e.g., waterfall, 
					incremental, or spiral) </li>
					<li>Attributes of the work products and tasks (e.g., size or 
					complexity) </li>
					<li>Schedule </li>
					<li>Models or historical data for converting the attributes 
					of the work products and tasks into labor hours and cost
					</li>
					<li>Methodology (e.g., models, data, algorithms) used to 
					determine needed material, skills, labor hours, and cost
					<br />
					<br />
					Documentation of the estimating rationale and supporting 
					data is needed for stakeholders’ review and commitment to 
					the plan and for maintenance of the plan as the project 
					progresses. <br />
					<br />
					<a name="sp1.1"></a><b>SP 1.1 Estimate the Scope of 
					the Project</b> <br />
					<br />
					Establish a top-level work breakdown structure (WBS) to 
					estimate the scope of the project. <br />
					<br />
					The WBS evolves with the project. Initially a top-level WBS 
					can serve to structure the initial estimating. The 
					development of a WBS divides the overall project into an 
					interconnected set of manageable components. Typically, the 
					WBS is a product oriented structure that provides a scheme 
					for identifying and organizing the logical units of work to 
					be managed, which are called “work packages.” The WBS 
					provides a reference and organizational mechanism for 
					assigning effort, schedule, and responsibility and is used 
					as the underlying framework to plan, organize, and control 
					the work done on the project. Some projects use the term 
					“contract WBS” to refer to the portion of the WBS placed 
					under contract (possibly the entire WBS). Not all projects 
					have a contract WBS (e.g., internally funded development).
					<br />
					<br />
					Typical Work Products <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Task descriptions </li>
					<li>Work package descriptions </li>
					<li>WBS <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 1: Develop a WBS based on the product 
					architecture. <br />
					<br />
					The WBS provides a scheme for organizing the project’s work 
					around the product and product components that the work 
					supports. The WBS should permit the identification of the 
					following items: <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Identified risks and their mitigation tasks </li>
					<li>Tasks for deliverables and supporting activities </li>
					<li>Tasks for skill and knowledge acquisition </li>
					<li>Tasks for development of needed support plans, such as 
					configuration management, quality assurance, and 
					verification plans </li>
					<li>Tasks for integration and management of nondevelopmental 
					items <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 2: Identify the work packages in sufficient 
					detail to specify estimates of project tasks, 
					responsibilities, and schedule. <br />
					<br />
					The top-level WBS is intended to help in gauging the project 
					work effort in terms of tasks and organizational roles and 
					responsibilities. The amount of detail in the WBS at this 
					more detailed level helps in developing realistic schedules, 
					thereby minimizing the need for management reserve. <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 3: Identify product or product components that 
					will be externally acquired. <br />
					<br />
					Refer to the Supplier Agreement Management process area for 
					more information about acquiring products from sources 
					external to the project. <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 4: Identify work products that will be reused.
					<br />
					<br />
					<a name="sp1.2"></a><b>SP 1.2 Establish Estimates of Work 
					Product and Task Attributes</b> <br />
					<br />
					Establish and maintain estimates of the attributes of the 
					work products and tasks. <br />
					<br />
					Size is the primary input to many models used to estimate 
					effort, cost, and schedule. The models can also be based on 
					inputs such as connectivity, complexity, and structure.
					<br />
					<br />
					Examples of types of work products for which size estimates 
					are made include the following: <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Deliverable and nondeliverable work products </li>
					<li>Documents and files </li>
					<li>Operational and support hardware, firmware, and software
					<br />
					<br />
					Examples of size measures include the following: <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Number of functions </li>
					<li>Function points </li>
					<li>Source lines of code </li>
					<li>Number of classes and objects </li>
					<li>Number of requirements </li>
					<li>Number and complexity of interfaces </li>
					<li>Number of pages </li>
					<li>Number of inputs and outputs </li>
					<li>Number of technical risk items </li>
					<li>Volume of data </li>
					<li>Number of logic gates for integrated circuits </li>
					<li>Number of parts (e.g., printed circuit boards, 
					components, and mechanical parts) </li>
					<li>Physical constraints (e.g., weight and volume) <br />
					<br />
					The estimates should be consistent with project requirements 
					to determine the project’s effort, cost, and schedule. A 
					relative level of difficulty or complexity should be 
					assigned for each size attribute. <br />
					<br />
					Typical Work Products <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Technical approach </li>
					<li>Size and complexity of tasks and work products </li>
					<li>Estimating models </li>
					<li>Attribute estimates <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 1: Determine the technical approach for the 
					project. <br />
					<br />
					The technical approach defines a top-level strategy for 
					development of the product. It includes decisions on 
					architectural features, such as distributed or 
					client/server; state-of-the-art or established technologies 
					to be applied, such as robotics, composite materials, or 
					artificial intelligence; and breadth of the functionality 
					expected in the final products, such as safety, security, 
					and ergonomics. <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 2: Use appropriate methods to determine the 
					attributes of the work products and tasks that will be used 
					to estimate the resource requirements. <br />
					<br />
					Methods for determining size and complexity should be based 
					on validated models or historical data. <br />
					<br />
					The methods for determining attributes evolve as our 
					understanding of the relationship of product characteristics 
					to attributes increases. <br />
					<br />
					Examples of current methods include the following: <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Number of logic gates for integrated circuit design </li>
					<li>Lines of code or function points for software </li>
					<li>Number/complexity of requirements for systems 
					engineering </li>
					<li>Number of square feet for standard-specified residential 
					homes <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 3: Estimate the attributes of the work products 
					and tasks. <br />
					<br />
					<a name="sp1.3"></a><b>SP 1.3 Define Project Lifecycle</b>
					<br />
					<br />
					Define the project lifecycle phases on which to scope the 
					planning effort. <br />
					<br />
					The determination of a project’s lifecycle phases provides 
					for planned periods of evaluation and decision making. These 
					are normally defined to support logical decision points at 
					which significant commitments are made concerning resources 
					and technical approach. Such points provide planned events 
					at which project course corrections and determinations of 
					future scope and cost can be made. <br />
					<br />
					The project lifecycle phases need to be defined depending on 
					the scope of requirements, the estimates for project 
					resources, and the nature of the project. Larger projects 
					may contain multiple phases, such as concept exploration, 
					development, production, operations, and disposal. Within 
					these phases, subphases may be needed. A development phase 
					may include subphases such as requirements analysis, design, 
					fabrication, integration, and verification. The 
					determination of project phases typically includes selection 
					and refinement of one or more development models to address 
					interdependencies and appropriate sequencing of the 
					activities in the phases. <br />
					<br />
					Depending on the strategy for development, there may be 
					intermediate phases for the creation of prototypes, 
					increments of capability, or spiral model cycles. <br />
					<br />
					Understanding the project lifecycle is crucial in 
					determining the scope of the planning effort and the timing 
					of the initial planning, as well as the timing and criteria 
					(critical milestones) for replanning. <br />
					<br />
					Typical Work Products </li>
					<li>Project lifecycle phases <br />
					<br />
					<a name="sp1.4"></a><b>SP 1.4 Determine Estimates of Effort 
					and Cost</b> <br />
					<br />
					Estimate the project effort and cost for the work products 
					and tasks based on estimation rationale. <br />
					<br />
					Estimates of effort and cost are generally based on the 
					results of analysis using models or historical data applied 
					to size, activities, and other planning parameters. 
					Confidence in these estimates is based on the rationale for 
					the selected model and the nature of the data. There may be 
					occasions when the available historical data does not apply, 
					such as where efforts are unprecedented or where the type of 
					task does not fit available models. An effort is 
					unprecedented (to some degree) if a similar product or 
					component has never been built. An effort may also be 
					unprecedented if the development group has never built such 
					a product or component. <br />
					<br />
					Unprecedented efforts are more risky, require more research 
					to develop reasonable bases of estimate, and require more 
					management reserve. The uniqueness of the project must be 
					documented when using these models to ensure a common 
					understanding of any assumptions made in the initial 
					planning stages. <br />
					<br />
					Typical Work Products <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Estimation rationale </li>
					<li>Project effort estimates </li>
					<li>Project cost estimates <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 1: Collect the models or historical data that 
					will be used to transform the attributes of the work 
					products and tasks into estimates of the labor hours and 
					cost. <br />
					<br />
					Many parametric models have been developed to aid in 
					estimating cost and schedule. The use of these models as the 
					sole source of estimation is not recommended because these 
					models are based on historical project data that may or may 
					not be pertinent to your project. Multiple models and/or 
					methods can be used to ensure a high level of confidence in 
					the estimate. <br />
					<br />
					Historical data include the cost, effort, and schedule data 
					from previously executed projects, plus appropriate scaling 
					data to account for differing sizes and complexity. <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 2: Include supporting infrastructure needs when 
					estimating effort and cost. <br />
					<br />
					The supporting infrastructure includes resources needed from 
					a development and sustainment perspective for the product.
					<br />
					<br />
					Consider the infrastructure resource needs in the 
					development environment, the test environment, the 
					production environment, the target environment, or any 
					appropriate combination of these when estimating effort and 
					cost. <br />
					<br />
					Examples of infrastructure resources include the following:
					<br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Critical computer resources (e.g., memory, disk and 
					network capacity, peripherals, communication channels, and 
					the capacities of these) </li>
					<li>Engineering environments and tools (e.g., tools for 
					prototyping, assembly, computer-aided design [CAD], and 
					simulation) </li>
					<li>Facilities, machinery, and equipment (e.g., test benches 
					and recording devices) <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 3: Estimate effort and cost using models and/or 
					historical data. <br />
					<br />
					Effort and cost inputs used for estimating typically include 
					the following: <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Judgmental estimates provided by an expert or group of 
					experts (e.g., Delphi Method) </li>
					<li>Risks, including the extent to which the effort is 
					unprecedented </li>
					<li>Critical competencies and roles needed to perform the 
					work </li>
					<li>Product and product component requirements </li>
					<li>Technical approach </li>
					<li>WBS </li>
					<li>Size estimates of work products and anticipated changes
					</li>
					<li>Cost of externally acquired products </li>
					<li>Selected project lifecycle model and processes </li>
					<li>Lifecycle cost estimates </li>
					<li>Capability of tools provided in engineering environment
					</li>
					<li>Skill levels of managers and staff needed to perform the 
					work </li>
					<li>Knowledge, skill, and training needs </li>
					<li>Facilities needed (e.g., office and meeting space and 
					workstations) </li>
					<li>Engineering facilities needed </li>
					<li>Capability of manufacturing process(es) </li>
					<li>Travel </li>
					<li>Level of security required for tasks, work products, 
					hardware, software, personnel, and work environment </li>
					<li>Service level agreements for call centers and warranty 
					work </li>
					<li>Direct labor and overhead <br />
					<br />
					<a name="sg2"></a><b>SG 2 Develop a Project Plan</b> <br />
					<br />
					A project plan is established and maintained as the basis 
					for managing the project. <br />
					<br />
					A project plan is a formal, approved document used to manage 
					and control the execution of the project. It is based on the 
					project requirements and the established estimates. <br />
					<br />
					The project plan should consider all phases of the project 
					lifecycle. Project planning should ensure that all plans 
					affecting the project are consistent with the overall 
					project plan. <br />
					<br />
					<a name="sp2.1"></a><b>SP 2.1 Establish the Budget and 
					Schedule</b> <br />
					<br />
					Establish and maintain the project’s budget and schedule.
					<br />
					<br />
					The project’s budget and schedule are based on the developed 
					estimates and ensure that budget allocation, task 
					complexity, and task dependencies are appropriately 
					addressed. <br />
					<br />
					Event-driven, resource-limited schedules have proven to be 
					effective in dealing with project risk. Identifying 
					accomplishments to be demonstrated before initiation of the 
					event provides some flexibility in the timing of the event, 
					a common understanding of what is expected, a better vision 
					of the state of the project, and a more accurate status of 
					the project’s tasks. <br />
					<br />
					Typical Work Products <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Project schedules </li>
					<li>Schedule dependencies </li>
					<li>Project budget <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 1: Identify major milestones. <br />
					<br />
					Milestones are often imposed to ensure completion of certain 
					deliverables by the milestone. Milestones can be event based 
					or calendar based. If calendar based, once milestone dates 
					have been agreed on, it is often very difficult to change 
					them. <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 2: Identify schedule assumptions. <br />
					<br />
					When schedules are initially developed, it is common to make 
					assumptions about the duration of certain activities. These 
					assumptions are frequently made on items for which little if 
					any estimation data is available. Identifying these 
					assumptions provides insight into the level of confidence 
					(uncertainties) in the overall schedule. <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 3: Identify constraints. <br />
					<br />
					Factors that limit the flexibility of management options 
					need to be identified as early as possible. The examination 
					of the attributes of the work products and tasks often will 
					bring these issues to the surface. Such attributes can 
					include task duration, resources, inputs, and outputs. <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 4: Identify task dependencies. <br />
					<br />
					Typically, the tasks for a project can be accomplished in 
					some ordered sequence that will minimize the duration of the 
					project. This involves the identification of predecessor and 
					successor tasks to determine the optimal ordering. <br />
					<br />
					Examples of tools that can help determine an optimal 
					ordering of task activities include the following: <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Critical Path Method (CPM) </li>
					<li>Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) </li>
					<li>Resource-limited scheduling <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 5: Define the budget and schedule. <br />
					<br />
					Establishing and maintaining the project’s budget and 
					schedule typically includes the following: <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Defining the committed or expected availability of 
					resources and facilities </li>
					<li>Determining time phasing of activities </li>
					<li>Determining a breakout of subordinate schedules </li>
					<li>Defining the dependencies between the activities 
					(predecessor or successor relationships) </li>
					<li>Defining the schedule activities and milestones to 
					support accuracy in progress measurement </li>
					<li>Identifying milestones for delivery of products to the

					<br />
					Subpractice 6: Establish corrective action criteria. <br />
					<br />
					Criteria are established for determining what constitutes a 
					significant deviation from the project plan. A basis for 
					gauging issues and problems is necessary to determine when a 
					corrective action should be taken. The corrective actions 
					may require replanning, which may include revising the 
					original plan, establishing new agreements, or including 
					mitigation activities within the current plan. <br />

					Subpractice 1: Identify risks. <br />
					<br />
					The identification of risks involves the identification of 
					potential issues, hazards, threats, vulnerabilities, and so 
					on that could negatively affect work efforts and plans. 
					Risks must be identified and described in an understandable 
					way before they can be analyzed. When identifying risks, it 
					is a good idea to use a standard method for defining risks. 
					Risk identification and analysis tools can be used to help 
					identify possible problems. <br />
					<br />
					Examples of risk identification and analysis tools include 
					the following: <br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>Risk taxonomies </li>

					<br />
					When integrated teams are formed, project data includes data 
					developed and used solely within a particular team as well 
					as data applicable across integrated team boundaries, if 
					there are multiple integrated teams. <br />
					<br />
					Data are the various forms of documentation required to 
					support a program in all of its areas (e.g., administration, 
					engineering, configuration management, finance, logistics, 
					quality, safety, manufacturing, and procurement). The data 
					can take any form (e.g., reports, manuals, notebooks, 
					charts, drawings, specifications, files, or correspondence). 
					The data may exist in any medium (e.g., printed or drawn on 
					various materials, photographs, electronic, or multimedia). 
					Data may be deliverable (e.g., items identified by a 
					program’s contract data requirements) or data may be 
					nondeliverable (e.g., informal data, trade studies and 
					analyses, internal meeting minutes, internal design review 
					documentation, lessons learned, and action items). 
					Distribution can take many forms, including electronic 
					transmission. <br />
					<br />
					The data requirements for the project should be established 
					for both the data items to be created and their content and 
					form, based on a common or standard set of data 
					requirements. Uniform content and format requirements for 
					data items facilitate understanding of data content and help 
					with consistent management of the data resources. <br />
					<br />
					The reason for collecting each document should be clear. 
					This task includes the analysis and verification of project 
					deliverables and nondeliverables, contract and noncontract 
					data requirements, and customer-supplied data. Often, data 
					is collected with no clear understanding of how it will be 
					used. Data is costly and should be collected only when 
					needed. <br />

					Subpractice 1: Establish requirements and procedures to 
					ensure privacy and security of the data. <br />
					<br />
					Not everyone will have the need or clearance necessary to 
					access the project data. Procedures must be established to 
					identify who has access to what data as well as when they 
					have access to the data. <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 2: Establish a mechanism to archive data and to 
					access archived data. <br />

					Accessed information should be in an understandable form 
					(e.g., electronic or computer output from a database) or 
					represented as originally generated. <br />

					<br />
					When integrated teams are formed, planning for project 
					resources should consider staffing of the integrated teams.
					<br />
					<br />
					Defining project resources (labor, machinery/equipment, 
					materials, and methods) and quantities needed to perform 
					project activities builds on the initial estimates and 
					provides additional information that can be applied to 
					expand the WBS used to manage the project. <br />
					<br />
					The top-level WBS developed earlier as an estimation 
					mechanism is typically expanded by decomposing these top 
					levels into work packages that represent singular work units 
					that can be separately assigned, performed, and tracked. 
					This subdivision is done to distribute management 
					responsibility and provide better management control. Each 
					work package or work product in the WBS should be assigned a 
					unique identifier (e.g., number) to permit tracking. A WBS 
					can be based on requirements, activities, work products, or 
					a combination of these items. A dictionary that describes 
					the work for each work package in the WBS should accompany 
					the work breakdown structure. <br />
					<br />

					<li>Process/workflow definitions and diagrams </li>
					<li>Program administration requirements list <br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 1: Determine process requirements. <br />
					<br />
					The processes used to manage a project must be identified, 
					defined, and coordinated with all the relevant stakeholders 
					to ensure efficient operations during project execution.
					<br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 2: Determine staffing requirements. <br />
					<br />
					The staffing of a project depends on the decomposition of 
					the project requirements into tasks, roles, and 
					responsibilities for accomplishing the project requirements 
					as laid out within the work packages of the WBS. <br />
					<br />
					Staffing requirements must consider the knowledge and skills 
					required for each of the identified positions, as defined in 
					the Plan for Needed Knowledge and Skills specific practice.
					<br />
					<br />
					Subpractice 3: Determine facilities, equipment, and 
					component requirements. <br />
					<br />
					Most projects are unique in some sense and require some set 
					of unique assets to accomplish the objectives of the 
					project. The determination and acquisition of these assets 
					in a timely manner are crucial to project success. <br />
					<br />
					Lead-time items need to be identified early to determine how 
					they will be addressed. Even when the required assets are 
					not unique, compiling a list of all of the facilities, 
					equipment, and parts (e.g., number of computers for the 
					personnel working on the project, software applications, and 
					office space) provides insight into aspects of the scope of 
					an effort that are often overlooked. <br />

					<li>In-house training (both organizational and project) </li>
					<li>External training </li>
					<li>Staffing and new hires </li>
					<li>External skill acquisition <br />
					<br />
					The choice of in-house training or outsourced training for

					<a name="sp2.6"></a><b>SP 2.6 Plan Stakeholder Involvement</b>
					<br />
					<br />
					Plan the involvement of identified stakeholders. <br />
					<br />
					IPPD Addition <br />
					<br />
					When integrated teams are formed, stakeholder involvement 
					should be planned down to the integrated team level. <br />
					<br />
					Stakeholders are identified from all phases of the project 
					lifecycle by identifying the type of people and functions 
					needing representation in the project and describing their 
					relevance and the degree of interaction for specific project 
					activities. A two-dimensional matrix with stakeholders along 
					one axis and project activities along the other axis is a 
					convenient format for accomplishing this identification. 
					Relevance of the stakeholder to the activity in a particular 
					project phase and the amount of interaction expected would 
					be shown at the intersection of the project phase activity 
					axis and the stakeholder axis. <br />
					<br />
					For the inputs of stakeholders to be useful, careful 
					selection of relevant stakeholders is necessary. For each 
					major activity, identify the stakeholders who are affected 
					by the activity and those who have expertise that is needed 
					to conduct the activity. This list of relevant stakeholders 
					will probably change as the project moves through the phases 
					of the project lifecycle. It is important, however, to 
					ensure that relevant stakeholders in the latter phases of 
					the lifecycle have early input to requirements and design 
					decisions that affect them. <br />
					<br />
					Examples of the type of material that should be included in 
					a plan for stakeholder interaction include the following:
					<br />
					<br />
					</li>
					<li>List of all relevant stakeholders </li>
					<li>Rationale for stakeholder involvement </li>
					<li>Roles and responsibilities of the relevant stakeholders

					<li>Resources (e.g., training, materials, time, and funding) 
					needed to ensure stakeholder interaction </li>
					<li>Schedule for phasing of stakeholder interaction <br />

					<br />
					A documented plan that addresses all relevant planning items 
					is necessary to achieve the mutual understanding, 
					commitment, and performance of individuals, groups, and 
					organizations that must execute or support the plans. The 
					plan generated for the project defines all aspects of the 
					effort, tying together in a logical manner: project 
					lifecycle considerations; technical and management tasks; 
					budgets and schedules; milestones; data management, risk 
					identification, resource and skill requirements; and

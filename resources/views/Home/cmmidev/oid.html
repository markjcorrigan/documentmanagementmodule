<b>Purpose</b>
</center>
<br>
<br>
The purpose of Organizational Innovation and Deployment (OID) is to select and deploy incremental and innovative improvements that measurably improve the organization’s processes and technologies. The improvements support the organization’s quality and process-performance objectives as derived from the organization’s business objectives.
<br>
<br>
<center>
<b>
Introductory Notes
</b>
</center>
<br>
<br>
The Organizational Innovation and Deployment process area enables the selection and deployment of improvements that can enhance the organization’s ability to meet its quality and process-performance objectives. (See the definition of “quality and process-performance objectives” in the glossary.) The term “improvement,” as used in this process area, refers to all of the ideas (proven and unproven) that would change the organization’s processes and technologies to better meet the organization’s quality and process-performance objectives.
<br>
<br>
Quality and process-performance objectives that this process area might address include the following:
<br>
<br>
<li>Improved product quality (e.g., functionality, performance)
</li><li>Increased productivity
</li><li>Decreased cycle time
</li><li>Greater customer and end-user satisfaction
</li><li>Shorter development or production time to change functionality or add new features, or adapt to new technologies
</li><li>Reduce delivery time
</li><li>Reduce time to adapt to new technologies and business needs
<br>
<br>
Achievement of these objectives depends on the successful establishment of an infrastructure that enables and encourages all people in the organization to propose potential improvements to the organization’s processes and technologies. Achievement of these objectives also depends on being able to effectively evaluate and deploy proposed improvements to the organization’s processes and technologies. All members of the organization can participate in the organization’s process- and technology-improvement activities. Their proposals are systematically gathered and addressed.
<br>
<br>
Pilots are conducted to evaluate significant changes involving untried, high-risk, or innovative improvements before they are broadly deployed.
<br>
<br>
Process and technology improvements that will be deployed across the organization are selected from process- and technology-improvement proposals based on the following criteria:
<br>
<br>
</li><li>A quantitative understanding of the organization’s current quality and process performance
</li><li>The organization’s quality and process-performance objectives
</li><li>Estimates of the improvement in quality and process performance resulting from deploying the process and technology improvements
</li><li>Estimated costs of deploying process and technology improvements, and the resources and funding available for such deployment
<br>
<br>
The expected benefits added by the process and technology improvements are weighed against the cost and impact to the organization. Change and stability must be balanced carefully. Change that is too great or too rapid can overwhelm the organization, destroying its investment in organizational learning represented by organizational process assets. Rigid stability can result in stagnation, allowing the changing business environment to erode the organization’s business position.
<br>
<br>
Improvements are deployed, as appropriate, to new and ongoing projects.
<br>
<br>
In this process area, the term “process and technology improvements” refers to incremental and innovative improvements to processes and also to process or product technologies (including project work environments).
<br>
<br>
The informative material in this process area is written with the assumption that the specific practices are applied to a quantitatively managed process. The specific practices of this process area may be applicable, but with reduced value, if the assumption is not met.
<br>
<br>
The specific practices in this process area complement and extend those found in the Organizational Process Focus process area. The focus of this process area is process improvement that is based on a quantitative knowledge of the organization’s set of standard processes and technologies and their expected quality and performance in predictable situations. In the Organizational Process Focus process area, no assumptions are made about the quantitative basis of improvement.
<br>
<br>

<b>SP 1.1 Collect and Analyze Improvement Proposals</b>
<br>
<br>
Collect and analyze process- and technology-improvement proposals.
<br>
<br>
Each process- and technology-improvement proposal must be analyzed.
<br>
<br>
Simple process and technology improvements, with well-understood benefits and effects, will not usually undergo detailed evaluations.
<br>
<br>
Examples of simple process and technology improvements include the following:
<br>
<br>
</li><li>Add an item to a peer review checklist.
</li><li>Combine the technical review and management review for suppliers into a single technical/management review.
<br>
<br>
Typical Work Products
<br>
<br>
</li><li>Analyzed process- and technology-improvement proposals
Subpractice 1: Collect process- and technology-improvement proposals.
<br>
<br>
A process- and technology-improvement proposal documents proposed incremental and innovative improvements to specific processes and technologies. Managers and staff in the organization, as well as customers, end users, and suppliers can submit process- and technology-improvement proposals. Process and technology improvements may be implemented at the local level before being proposed for the organization.
<br>
<br>
Examples of sources for process- and technology-improvement proposals include the following:
<br>
<br>
</li><li>Findings and recommendations from process appraisals
</li><li>The organization’s quality and process-performance objectives
</li><li>Analysis of data about customer and end-user problems as well as customer and end-user satisfaction
</li><li>Analysis of data about project performance compared to quality and productivity objectives
</li><li>Analysis of technical performance measures
</li><li>Results of process and product benchmarking efforts
</li><li>Analysis of data on defect causes
</li><li>Measured effectiveness of process activities
</li><li>Measured effectiveness of project work environments
</li><li>Examples of process- and technology-improvement proposals that were successfully adopted elsewhere
</li><li>Feedback on previously submitted process- and technology-improvement proposals
</li><li>Spontaneous ideas from managers and staff
<br>
<br>
Refer to the Organizational Process Focus process area for more information about process- and technology-improvement proposals.
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 2: Analyze the costs and benefits of process- and technology-improvement proposals as appropriate.
Process- and technology-improvement proposals that have a large cost-to-benefit ratio are rejected.
<br>
<br>
Criteria for evaluating costs and benefits include the following:
<br>
<br>
</li><li>Contribution toward meeting the organization’s quality and process-performance objectives
</li><li>Effect on mitigating identified project and organizational risks
</li><li>Ability to respond quickly to changes in project requirements, market situations, and the business environment
</li><li>Effect on related processes and associated assets
</li><li>Cost of defining and collecting data that supports the measurement and analysis of the process- and technology-improvement proposal
</li><li>Expected life span of the proposal
<br>
<br>
Process- and technology-improvement proposals that would not improve the organization's processes are rejected.
<br>
<br>
Process-performance models provide insight into the effect of process changes on process capability and performance.
<br>
<br>
Refer to the Organizational Process Performance process area for more information about process-performance models.
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 3: Identify the process- and technology-improvement proposals that are innovative.
<br>
<br>
Innovative improvements are also identified and analyzed in the Identify and Analyze Innovations specific practice.
<br>
<br>
Whereas this specific practice analyzes proposals that have been passively collected, the purpose of the Identify and Analyze Innovations specific practice is to actively search for and locate innovative improvements. The search primarily involves looking outside the organization.
<br>
<br>
Innovative improvements are typically identified by reviewing process- and technology-improvement proposals or by actively investigating and monitoring innovations that are in use in other organizations or are documented in research literature. Innovation may be inspired by internal improvement objectives or by the external business environment.
<br>
<br>
Innovative improvements are typically major changes to the process that represent a break from the old way of doing things (e.g., changing the lifecycle model). Innovative improvements may also include changes in the products that support, enhance, or automate the process (e.g., using off-the-shelf products to support the process).
<br>
<br>
Examples of innovative improvements include the following:
<br>
<br>
</li><li>Advances in computer and related hardware products
</li><li>New support tools
</li><li>New techniques, methodologies, processes, or lifecycle models
</li><li>New interface standards
</li><li>New reusable components
</li><li>New management techniques
</li><li>New quality-improvement techniques
</li><li>New process development and deployment support tools
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 4: Identify potential barriers and risks to deploying each process- and technology-improvement proposal.
<br>
<br>
Examples of barriers to deploying process and technology improvements include the following:
<br>
<br>
</li><li>Turf guarding and parochial perspectives
</li><li>Unclear or weak business rationale
</li><li>Lack of short-term benefits and visible successes
</li><li>Unclear picture of what is expected from everyone
</li><li>Too many changes at the same time
</li><li>Lack of involvement and support of relevant stakeholders
<br>
<br>
Examples of risk factors that affect the deployment of process and technology improvements include the following:
<br>
<br>
</li><li>Compatibility of the improvement with existing processes, values, and skills of potential end users
</li><li>Complexity of the improvement
</li><li>Difficulty implementing the improvement
</li><li>Ability to demonstrate the value of the improvement before widespread deployment
</li><li>Justification for large, up-front investments in areas such as tools and training
</li><li>Inability to overcome “technology drag” where the current implementation is used successfully by a large and mature installed base of end users
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 5: Estimate the cost, effort, and schedule required for deploying each process- and technology-improvement proposal.
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 6: Select the process- and technology-improvement proposals to be piloted before broadscale deployment.
<br>
<br>
Since innovations, by definition, usually represent a major change, most innovative improvements will be piloted.
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 7: Document the results of the evaluation of each process- and technology-improvement proposal.
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 8: Monitor the status of each process- and technology-improvement proposal.
<br>
<br>

<b>SP 1.2 Identify and Analyze Innovations</b>
<br>
<br>
Identify and analyze innovative improvements that could increase the organization’s quality and process performance.
<br>
<br>
The specific practice, Collect and Analyze Improvement Proposals, analyzes proposals that are passively collected. The purpose of this specific practice is to actively search for, locate, and analyze innovative improvements. This search primarily involves looking outside the organization.
<br>
<br>
Typical Work Products
<br>
<br>
</li><li>Candidate innovative improvements
</li><li>Analysis of proposed innovative improvements
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 1: Analyze the organization's set of standard processes to determine areas where innovative improvements would be most helpful.
<br>
<br>
These analyses are performed to determine which subprocesses are critical to achieving the organization’s quality and process-performance objectives and which ones are good candidates to be improved.
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 2: Investigate innovative improvements that may improve the organization's set of standard processes.
<br>
<br>
Investigating innovative improvements involves the following:
<br>
<br>
</li><li>Systematically maintaining awareness of leading relevant technical work and technology trends
</li><li>Periodically searching for commercially available innovative improvements
</li><li>Collecting proposals for innovative improvements from the projects and the organization
</li><li>Systematically reviewing processes and technologies used externally and comparing them to those used within the organization
</li><li>Identifying areas where innovative improvements have been used successfully, and reviewing data and documentation of experience using these improvements
</li><li>Identifying improvements that integrate new technology into products and project work environments
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 3: Analyze potential innovative improvements to understand their effects on process elements and predict their influence on the process.
<br>
<br>
Process-performance models can provide a basis for analyzing possible effects of changes to process elements.
<br>
<br>
Refer to the Organizational Process Performance process area for more information about process-performance models.
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 4: Analyze the costs and benefits of potential innovative improvements.
<br>
<br>
Innovative improvements that have a very large cost-to-benefit ratio are rejected.
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 5: Create process- and technology-improvement proposals for those innovative improvements that would result in improving the organization's processes or technologies.
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 6: Select the innovative improvements to be piloted before broadscale deployment.
<br>
<br>
Since innovations, by definition, usually represent a major change, most innovative improvements will be piloted.
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 7: Document the results of the evaluations of innovative improvements.
<br>
<br>
<a name="sp13"></a> 
<b>SP 1.3 Pilot Improvements</b>
<br>
<br>
Pilot process and technology improvements to select which ones to implement.
<br>
<br>
Pilots are performed to assess new and unproven major changes before they are broadly deployed, as appropriate.
<br>
<br>
The implementation of this specific practice may overlap with the implementation of the Implement the Action Proposals specific practice in the Causal Analysis and Resolution process area (e.g., when causal analysis and resolution is implemented organizationally or across multiple projects).
<br>
<br>
Typical Work Products
<br>
<br>
</li><li>Pilot evaluation reports
</li><li>Documented lessons learned from pilots
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 1: Plan the pilots.
<br>
<br>
When planning pilots, it is critical to define quantitative criteria to be used for evaluating pilot results.
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 2: Review and get relevant stakeholder agreement on the plans for the pilots.
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 3: Consult with and assist the people performing the pilots.
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 4: Perform each pilot in an environment that is characteristic of the environment present in a broadscale deployment.
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 5: Track the pilots against their plans.
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 6: Review and document the results of pilots.
<br>
<br> 
Pilot results are evaluated using the quantitative criteria defined during pilot planning. Reviewing and documenting the results of pilots usually involves the following:
<br>
<br>
</li><li>Deciding whether to terminate the pilot, replan and continue the pilot, or proceed with deploying the process and technology improvement
</li><li>Updating the disposition of process- and technology-improvement proposals associated with the pilot
</li><li>Identifying and documenting new process- and technology-improvement proposals as appropriate
</li><li>Identifying and documenting lessons learned and problems encountered during the pilot
<br>

<b>SP 1.4 Select Improvements for Deployment</b>
<br>
<br>
Select process and technology improvements for deployment across the organization.
<br>
<br>
Selection of process and technology improvements for deployment across the organization is based on quantifiable criteria derived from the organization’s quality and process-performance objectives.
<br>
<br>
Typical Work Products
<br>
<br>
</li><li>Process and technology improvements selected for deployment
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 1: Prioritize the candidate process and technology improvements for deployment.
<br>
<br>
Priority is based on an evaluation of the estimated cost-to-benefit ratio with regard to the quality and process-performance objectives.
<br>
<br>
Refer to the Organizational Process Performance process area for more information about quality and process-performance objectives.
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 2: Select the process and technology improvements to be deployed.
<br>
<br>
The selection of the process improvements is based on their priorities and the available resources.
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 3: Determine how each process and technology improvement will be deployed.
<br>
<br>
Examples of where the process and technology improvements may be deployed include the following:
<br>
<br>
</li><li>Organizational process assets
</li><li>Project-specific or common work environments
</li><li>Organization’s product families
</li><li>Organization's capabilities
</li><li>Organization’s projects
</li><li>Organizational groups
<br>
<br>
Subpractice 4: Document the results of the selection process.
<br>
<br>
The results of the selection process usually include the following:
<br>
<br>
</li><li>The selection criteria for candidate improvements
</li><li>The disposition of each improvement proposal

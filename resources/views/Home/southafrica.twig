              see very little under the new dispensation in South Africa to be proud of!&nbsp;
              Clearly, to me, based on all the evidence surrounding us daily (Zondo

                <p align="left">From the book: "Damage ... (caused by) Malignant Narcissism
                  (where does) this madness spring? Why this compulsion to change our society's
                  culture to mirror the Left (think radical and you have pinned down the term
                  Left) Elite's own worldview? This pattern of the Left Elite's projecting their
                  issues onto society isn't as odd as you may think. It makes perfect sense,
                  according to the most respected psychoanalysts of our age. Childhood trauma,
                  stress disorders, and the resulting malignant narcissism all play a part in the
                  Left's victim mentality and in their effort, mostly subconscious, to shape our
                  world to mirror their own damaged psyches.<br>
                  "A pattern of traits and
                  behaviors which signify infatuation and obsession with one's self to the
                  exclusion of all others and the egotistic and ruthless pursuit of one's
                  gratification, dominance and ambition."<br>
                  While narcissism takes root early,
                  it is possible to manage one's narcissism, especially with professional help,
                  and at least keep it from moving into the aggressively destructive stage of
                  malignant narcissism. The syndrome of malignant narcissism, originally described
                  by psychoanalyst Otto Kernberg, has been widely referred to by political
                  psychologists in characterizing leaders who pose a threat to civil society,
                  political stability, and world order. <br>
                  I (Tammy Bruce) know some of this is
                  a little technical, but stay with me. It's worth it, because it helps make sense
                  of so much of what is going on in the world. In an interview with the
                  semi-annual journal What Is Enlightenment?, Kernberg put it this way: This
                  pathological idealization of the self as an aggressive self clinically is called
                  "malignant narcissism." And this is very much connected with evil and with a
                  number of clinical forms that evil takes, such as the pleasure and enjoyment in
                  controlling others, in making them suffer, in destroying them, or the casual
                  pleasure in using others' trust and confidence and love to exploit them and to
                  destroy them.<br>
                  The core components of this syndrome are pathological
                  narcissism, antisocial features, paranoid traits, and aggression.
                  Self-preservation, self-promotion, and maintaining power are all traits that
                  prevail in the malignant narcissist. The people and issues they supposedly serve
                  exist only to be exploited for their own benefit."<br>
                  <br>
                  (This is from a review
                  of the book:) "And that is exactly why Bruce is right to target the moral
                  relativists. They not only seek to justify every evil action, but strip from us
                  the very ability to say "No, this is wrong". They talk about freedom and
                  tolerance, but what they really want is the freedom to do whatever they want and
                  for the rest of us to just tolerate it."</p>

              <p align="left">You do see that the State Capture Project was a corruption
                syndicate project run (<a href="home/carousel?slide=4" >at
                Capability Maturity Level ZERO</a>) by the ANC! <br>
                The project was run by
                elected government officials with the sole intention of bypassing the Public
                Finance Management Act (undermining Generally Accepted Accounting Practice and
                Governance Controls) with the specific aim of enriching certain ANC cadres
                through the proceeds of stolen tax money which was intended for the betterment
                of the people of the New South Africa (The Rainbow Nation, recommended by Nelson
                Mandela that we all voted for).<br>
                According to president ramaphoria (see article below released by the South
                African Press on 2019/10/15) this "state capture project" has cost the people of
                South Africa an estimated R500 Billion in tax revenue stolen, essentially by the
                ANC and under their auspices and watch!<br>
                This tax money, stolen by the ANC, is now forever lost, which could have been
                used to improve the our people as part of our vision - the Rainbow Nation.<br>
                You do understand that president ramaphoria was a part of the ANC while this
                disgusting and dastardly deed was being perpetrated. <br>
                Ramaphoria is same
                person who, along with the majority of ANC government officials, flatly ignored
                repeated demands from the South African Public to sort out the problem
                immediately!<br>
                I remember the Democratic Alliance begging Parliament to find president zuma
                unfit for duty in a number of motions of no confidence and each time the
                majority in the ANC gleefully (he he he) overturned the motion. Yet ramaphoria
                is now asking us to accept that it was "the others" (who are part of the "State
                Capture Project") that did this terrible thing!<br>
                However, these "others" are exactly those high ups in the ANC who remain un
                prosecuted and un-jailed for their crimes (of corruption and looting) against
                the people of South Africa!&nbsp; In fact, there is a very good chance that
                these "others" will "oust" ramaphoria early next year at the next ANC conference
                with ace (accused of massive corruption in the Orange Free State province, yet

              <p>That has not proven to be the case. Although Ramaphosa told foreign
                investment interests that Mzansi has now stemmed the bleeding from state
                capture, he conceded that a whopping R500 billion ($34 billion) may have been
                stolen during jacob zuma's nine-year tenure. That's not bleeding. That's the
                elevator doors opening up in The Shining.</p>
              <p>How much has state capture cost South Africa? That's a heck of a lot of
                money. It's just under half of what zuma wanted to give the Russians in exchange
                for an ill-conceived nuclear power deal. So perhaps we should be thankful?
                Well, that's not going to be easy. Not when you consider we could have spent
                that humongous wad of cash on the following:</p>
              <p>Over 5 000 new state-of-the-art schools. Around 10 billion pints of imported,
                premium beer; that's around 166 drinks each for every man, woman and child in
                South Africa. Almost 20 000 health clinics, fully-staffed and equipped with
                modern technology. Just under five billion kilograms of cheddar cheese. Around
                170 000 new Volkswagen Golf 1.4 litre engine (brand new). 400 million pairs of
                new Nike trainers. Thanks state capture 33 billion litres of petrol. 62.5
                million return flights from Johannesburg to Dubai, so we could *all* replicate
                the Guptas' escape from South Africa. Speaking of Dubai; You could build 12 more
                exact replicas of the tallest building in the world, The Burj Khalifa. You could
                wipe out Eskom's entire debt (R420 billion) and use the remaining cost of R80
                billion to buy the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom, belonging to Queen
                Elizabeth and her family. (All stats were provided by linked sources)</p>

          Essentially this means that our, THE RAINBOW NATIONS TAX cannot be
          put to good work as it is not available (stolen!).<br>
          Solution:&nbsp;
          Declare those doing this as enemies of the people! Rapidly apply the
          law and catch them, convict them and put them as fast as possible
          into jail!<br>
          This, serious lack of governance under the auspices

                  serious about turning around the South African
                  economy now / rapidly) in 2 most urgent things to do
                  now!:<br>
                  <br>
                  1. Get rid of BBBEE immediately!&nbsp;
                  BBBEE is the absolute antithesis of the Rainbow
                  Nation!&nbsp; BBBEE is simply Apartheid all over
                  again!&nbsp; BBBEE shows the height of bird brained
                  stupidity and why the ANC have Absolutely No Clue!<br>
                  As a white South African (who has always worked
                  towards a non racial South Africa) I find this
                  reverse Apartheid policy highly problematic, the
                  height of stupidity and extremely offensive. <br>
                  Its implementation (under the previous president
                  who's reputation (with state capture) is irreparably
                  tarnished) has single handedly destroyed the dreams
                  and aspirations of Nelson Mandela and many of the
                  South African population, and the wonderful idea of
                  a rainbow nation. <br>
                  May I be so bold as to say
                  that the ANC have Absolutely No Clue!&nbsp; You have
                  destroyed South Africa's vision! which incorporated
                  all races, creeds, colors, sexes as the Rainbow
                  Nation.&nbsp; You have also undermined the vision of
                  Nelson Mandela!&nbsp; Look at the very start of the
                  Strategy Wall.&nbsp; Do you see the VISION BRICK?
                  This single action (above all other stupidity of the
                  ANC government) sadly, is the height of stupidity
                  and short sightedness!?</p>
                <p align="center"><img class="img-fluid" src="{{ asset('storage/images/strategywall850.png') }}" ></p>
                <p align="left">The stupidity of this BBBEE policy
                  underpins at a fundamental level most of the
                  economic problems we South African's currently face.<br>
                  <b> I.e. you idiots, viewed from outside
                  (Internationally), have systematically destroyed the
                  vision of Nelson Mandela and your own BRAND!<br>
                  Again, how totally stupid is that?&nbsp; If you want
                  the economy to be jump started again you have to
                  destroy BBBEE and get back to the vision of the
                  Rainbow Nation and this being South Africa's brand.&nbsp;
                  Obviously,&nbsp; "<a href="/home/carousel?slide=3" >Vision
                  without execution is hallucination</a>" - Thomas
                  Edison.&nbsp; </b><br>
                  <br>
                  Remove BBBEE (respecting
                  all who live in this Country, as its Constitution
                  expects) and South Africa will start to heal
                  immediately as we appoint people into positions who
                  are educated, capable and mature (and put those who
                  are clearly corrupt into jail), thus reinstating a
                  respect for the Constitution and the Law). <br>
                  <br>
                  2. Stop threatening to take land away from
                  South African citizens! <br>
                  The New South Africa is based on respect and a
                  Constitution (Constitutional Rights) of which land
                  ownership is fundamental!<br>
                  Do you idiots not
                  understand what a mortgage bond (the legal document
                  of ownership) is and what it represents for societal
                  health, wellbeing and stability?<br>
                  A simple look
                  over our border at Zimbabwe will show anyone with
                  even a half a brain exactly what happens to an
                  economy when a government goes down this road. </p>
                <p align="left"> Many other points for improvement flow from PMWay.&nbsp;
                  However, points 1 and 2 above, IF IMPLEMENTED NOW, will
                  definitely create a positive mindset in South Africa and will
                  kick start the economy TODAY!<br>
                  Oh,... and if this is not very clear from the above. Citizens
                  found operating at Capability Maturity Level ZERO need to be
                  RAPIDLY PROSECUTED and must then GO DIRECTLY TO JAIL!<br>
                  The way you do this in Government is to strictly apply the
                  PFMA.&nbsp; I.e. ensure qualified people are in place and
                  empowered to enforce tight accountability per Generally
                  Accepted Accounting Principles of the PFMA (departmental
                  administration, projects and tenders that flow from this etc.). </p>

                              <p align="left"> On Wednesday the remains of former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe arrived to
                                a hero's welcome in Harare ahead of his burial early next week. He died in a
                                hospital in Singapore last Friday, aged 95. His body was received by that
                                country's head of state, Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, and a host of
                                other dignitaries. He will be laid to rest with a number of leaders in
                                attendance including President Cyril Ramaphosa. <br>
                                <br>
                                The reaction to his death has naturally been varied, from those hailing the
                                freedom fighter to those reviling him for his misrule. The fact though is that
                                Mugabe's mortal remains returned to a country destroyed by criminally poor
                                governance, a collapse of infrastructure and services and an economy destroyed
                                by mismanagement. He died in a hospital in a faraway land because his own
                                country was unable to provide the medical care he needed. <br>
                                <br>
                                Zimbabwe is a failed state. But Mugabe is being feted as if the country is a
                                shining beacon of prosperity. The destruction wrought on that country should be
                                his lasting legacy. <br>
                                <br>
                                Those that have experienced the misrule and tyranny of Robert Mugabe's
                                Zimbabwe have a duty to correct the false eulogies and hagiographies now being
                                peddled about that country's former president. And the only lesson to learn form
                                Mugabe is how not to run a country. </p>

            In doing this cadres, with absolutely not clue (or

            This barrage clearly
            is intended as a form of "gaslighting" to put decent South African Citizens up

            blow after blow! <br>

            really not needed.&nbsp; This morning, 2019/10/14 I woke up and read about "a
            new idea" to use South African's pensions to "save the economy!?"&nbsp; The mind
            boggles at the stupidity of even considering this as a viable option!<br>
            And if you try to challenge them with logical argument they...</p>

          <img alt="Playing chess with a pigeon brain" class="img-fluid" src="{{ asset('storage/images/thoughtfortheday.jpg') }}">
          <p align="left">Why would they do this?&nbsp; Apart from the obvious pigeon
            argument above the actions are fundamentally designed to "get us up against the
            ropes" and to create confusion so they (the gang of criminals) can steal
            billions of tax payers money intended for the Rainbow Nation and we are too
            bruised, abused or intimidated to object.&nbsp; And ultimately because, under
            zuma's clear strategy of destroying the Rainbow Nation goal of Nelson Mandela
            (and other decent South African Citizens of all races, creeds, sexes etc.),
            fundamentally they want what we have and because they cannot learn to play
            chess, this is the only way they can take our stuff from us. </p>
          <p align="center">The question is a simple one: <br>
            Why are these criminals who
            have stolen from the people of South Africa (the Rainbow Nation) not identified
            as "enemies of the people" and thrown into jail!?</p>
          <h1>Gaslighting: Signs You're Suffering From This Secret Form of Emotional Abuse</h1>
          <p> You know that you are self-aware. You have strong opinions,
            defined goals, and at the core, you know who you are.<br>
            <br>
            Then one day, seemingly out of nowhere, you begin doubting
            things. Questioning people's motives. Second-guessing what you
            want and who you are. Your confidence turns to suspicion. You
            feel neurotic and paranoid. You may even start to wonder, am I
            going crazy?</p>
          <p>You're not crazy.</p>
          <p>If you can identify
            with any of the feelings just mentioned, you may be a victim of
            the modern victimization trend: Gaslighting.</p>
          <h2>What is
            Gaslighting?</h2>
          <p>Gaslighting is a manipulative tactic in
            which a person, to gain power and control, plants seeds of
            uncertainty in the victim. The self-doubt and constant
            skepticism slowly and meticulously cause the individual to
            question their reality.</p>
          <h3>Definition of Gaslighting</h3>
          <p> Perhaps the best way to examine this inherently abusive behavior
            is to go straight to the source, the 1944 film Gaslight.  The
            film tells a story of a husband systematically brainwashing his
            wife to the point that she legitimately thinks she is going
            insane. The wife fights to protect her identity all while her
            husband viciously tries to take it away.</p>
          <p>While it never
            disappeared, over seven decades later, gaslighting has fully
            resurfaced in the world of victimization. Additionally, the term
            has resurfaced recently in some online publications to describe
            President Trump.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the movie Gaslight also
            touches on how gaslighting can lead to the victim developing a
            form of Stockholm Syndrome. The victim becomes so uncertain of
            their sense of reality that they are now solely dependent on the
            gaslighter.</p>
          <h3>Who is at risk?</h3>
          <p>One of the most
            troubling aspects of gaslighting is that everyone is at risk. In
            fact, it is a method commonly used by cult leaders and
            dictators. While many of us have the good sense to not join a
            cult, we can experience gaslighting in our personal
            relationships without even realizing it.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately,
            gaslighting is also used by abusers and narcissists, and it can
            be difficult realizing you may have those people in your life.
            Furthermore, gaslighting happens in a deliberately slow, precise
            way to ensure that the victim doesn't realize it's even
            happening.</p>
          <p>It's hard to recognize this type of abuse
            because, in addition to lying, the gaslighter may also be
            incredibly charming. At first, you may even find yourself
            feeling guilty that you are second-guessing this individual. The
            abuser uses tactics to prove your concerns otherwise and quickly
            you begin ignoring your gut. If it was wrong the first couple of
            times, it must always be wrong. This confusion is precisely what
            the abuser wants. As a result, without even realizing it, you
            are in an abusive relationship.</p>
          <h2>Examples of Gaslighting</h2>
          <p> So, are you a victim of gaslighting manipulation? Take a look at
            the following tell-tale signs of gaslighting behavior:</p>
          <h3>1.
            Blatant lying</h3>
          <p>First, people who gaslight tell obvious
            lies. You know that they are lying. The issue is how they are
            lying with such ease. The gaslighter is setting up an abusive
            pattern. You begin to question everything and become uncertain
            of the simplest matters. This self-doubt is exactly what the
            gaslighter wants.</p>
          <h3>2. Deny, Deny, Deny</h3>
          <p>Again, you
            know they said what they said. However, they completely deny
            ever saying it. The gaslighter may push the point and ask you to
            ‘prove it,' knowing that you only have your memory of the
            conversation that they are denying happened. It starts to make
            you question your memory and your reality. You begin to wonder
            if the gaslighter is right, maybe they didn't really ever say
            what you remember. Consequently, more and more often, you
            question your reality and accept theirs.</p>
          <h3>3. Using what
            you love against you</h3>
          <p>Additionally, people who gaslight
            use what is closest to you against you. If you love your job,
            they will find issues with it. If you have children, the
            gaslighter may force you to believe you should never have had
            them. This abusive manipulation tactic causes the victim to
            question the foundation of themselves as well as what they hold
            close.</p>
          <h3>4. The slow death of self</h3>
          <p>One of the
            terrifying parts of gaslighting is the methodical timeline that
            the abuser uses. The manipulation happens gradually and over
            time the victim morphs into someone entirely different. The most
            confident human being can become a shell of a person without
            being aware of it in the process. The victim's individual
            reality diminishes and becomes that of the abuser.</p>
          <h3>5.
            Words vs. Actions</h3>
          <p>Notably, a person who gaslights talks
            and talks. However, their words mean nothing. Therefore, it is
            important to look at what they are doing. The issues lie in
            their abusive actions towards the victim.</p>
          <h3>6. Love and
            flattery</h3>
          <p>A common technique of a person who gaslights is
            to tear you down and then build you back up, only to tear you
            down again. However, the uneasiness comes from the love and
            flattery. Whether you realize it or not, you are becoming used
            to being torn down. However, the praise may lead you to think
            that the abuser isn't all that bad.</p>
          <h3>7. Confusion</h3>
          <p> Without a doubt, people crave stability, and the gaslighter
            knows this. The constant confusion that the abuser has instilled
            leads the victim to become desperate for clarity. More often
            than not, the victim searches for this clarity in the abuser,
            thus continuing the cycle and increasing the power that the
            abuser has.</p>
          <h3>8. Projecting</h3>
          <p>If the gaslighter is a
            liar and a cheater, they are now accusing you of being a liar
            and a cheater. You constantly feel like you need to defend
            yourself for things you haven't done.</p>
          <h3>9. You're crazy</h3>
          <p> The gaslighter knows you are already questioning your sanity.
            The gaslighter also knows that you search for clarity in the
            person who is purposefully causing the confusion. Therefore,
            when they call you crazy, you believe it.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the
            gaslighter may also tell other people that you're crazy. This
            way if you were ever to approach them for help with your abuser,
            they wouldn't believe you. The gaslighter has given them a heads
            up that this would happen. You're too crazy to be taken
            seriously.</p>
          <h3>10. Everyone else is a liar</h3>
          <p>The abuser
            may also tell you that everyone else is against you and that
            they are all liars. Again, believing that everyone else is lying
            to you forces your sense of reality to be further blurred.
            People who gaslight want their victims to turn to them for
            everything so that they can continue the abuse.</p>
          <p> Ultimately, the quicker you can pick up on these gaslighting
            techniques, the better luck you will have to avoid a
            gaslighter's abuse and maintain the distinct reality of your
            circumstances.</p>
          <h2>Gaslighting Abuse</h2>
          <p>Gaslighting is a
            form of mental and emotional abuse. It promotes anxiety,
            depression, and can trigger mental breakdowns.</p>
          <p>Culturally,
            women are depicted as overly emotional, fragile things who cry
            at the drop of a hat. Furthermore, the label crazy is eagerly
            placed on any individual who expresses their feelings in a
            passionate way. You don't like certain behaviors you,re crazy.
            You have your own opinions you're crazy. As a result, crazy
            has become a term that others use to get off the hook for their
            own behavior.</p>
          <p>However, gaslighting is not women being
            overly emotional or crazy. Gaslighting is psychological abuse
            and cannot be overlooked.</p>
          <h3>The Gaslighter</h3>
          <p> Gaslighting is a technique commonly used by narcissists,
            sociopaths, and psychopaths. Since these are words we typically
            hear on television to describe a serial killer, you may not
            realize this person may be in your day to day life.</p>
          <h4> Narcissist</h4>
          <p>On a surface level, narcissistic people have
            an excessive admiration or obsession with themselves.
            Narcissistic abuse stems from the narcissist's utter inability
            to empathize with others. Individuals with Narcissistic
            Personality Disorder can be extremely manipulative and have no
            regard for the well-being of its victim.</p>
          <h4>Sociopath</h4>
          <p><a href="https://www.thrivetalk.com/sociopath/"> Sociopaths</a> exhibit complete lack of shame or remorse for
            their actions. <br>
            The personality disorder is loosely defined as a person with
            no conscience.</p>
          <h4>Psychopath</h4>
          <p>Psychopaths are people
            suffering from a chronic mental disorder that causes abnormal
            and violent social behavior.<br>
            While psychopaths, narcissists,
            and sociopaths are all over pop-culture, they are also
            everywhere in our day to day lives; we just may not realize it.</p>
          <h3>Gaslighting in Relationships</h3>
          <p>Important to realize,
            any relationship can be a victim of gaslighting.</p>
          <p> Gaslighting in a romantic relationship may be easier to notice,
            and the end goal of the abuser is often apparent to others. More
            often than not, in romantic relationships, the motive of
            gaslighting is to gain control.</p>
          <p>Conversely, gaslighting at
            work, or in relationships with friends or family members, can be
            more difficult to detect. It usually always involves control,
            money, or infidelity. Coupled with premeditated manipulation and
            gaslighting tactics, the people who gaslight usually get what
            they want and are successful at covering things up.</p>
          <h2>How
            To Deal With Gaslighting</h2>
          <p>Gaslighting emotional abuse
            causes psychological distress for its victims. With that being
            said, if you have experienced one form of gaslighting or
            another, you're not alone.</p>
          <p>The following list may help
            when faced with gaslighting:</p>
          <p align="left">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p align="left">First, try to clarify who is gaslighting you and how.
                Take notes of any time you have questioned your perception of reality. In
                order to move on, you need to confirm the gaslighting is happening.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p align="left">Additionally, set aside time to <a href="https://www.thrivetalk.com/meditation-101/#uxaptm"> meditate</a>. This will help you stay grounded and objective if the reality of
                your situation is ever questioned.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p align="left">Talk to friends or family members who you trust. Seek
                guidance from a therapist or mental health professional.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p align="left">Finally, shift your perspective. You are no longer a victim,
                you are a survivor.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <h2>Time to Rebuild</h2>
          <p>By and large, we are living in an unusual and
            frightening time. Gaslighting is being referred to as the newest
            victimization trend and even our President is being accused of
            gaslighting.</p>
          <p>The good news is, you can repair the damage.
            It is entirely possible to regain the confidence and self-worth
            that you lost at the hands of the abuser. Knowledge and
            awareness are crucial for the regrowth of clarity and sense of
            self. You're already on your way.</p>

<h3>Why the pigeons broke the Rainbow Nation?</h3>

<br>

<p>If you <a href="/register">Register</a> and <a href="/register">Login</a> to
this page in PMWay then you will see how PMWay &quot;tech&quot; is applied to understand
and solve the total lack of governance&nbsp; (corruption / low / no production)
problem being experienced in the &quot;New South Africa.&quot;<br><br>
Understanding that those in charge have &quot;Absolutely No Clue&quot; and are operating
at
<a href="/pmway/?slide=4" >Capability Maturity Level ZERO</a> (and the reason why they need to blame every one else for their incompetence) is one of
the sanity checks that PMWay offers.&nbsp; PMWay also suggests that the section
on &quot;gas-lighting&quot; will help those of us who are struggling to understand what
happened to our (and Nelson Mandela's) vision of the &quot;Rainbow Nation,&quot; and how to
protect ourselves against &quot;them&quot; that &quot;broke it,&quot; but who
are upping the heat against us.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

what we have built (because they are not Entrepreneurs and can't).&nbsp; This was clearly explained by George Orwell in his book &quot;<a href="{{ asset('storage/assets/animalfarm.pdf') }}" >Animal Farm</a>.&quot;&nbsp;
The other idea, that we are in fact dealing with pigeons with whom no logical
argument about the rules (of how to play chess or anything else) is possible, is also clearly explained.</p>

                    Regardless of the Constitution rights of all in
                    South Africa the ANC, driven by a rapacious greed coupled with incredible stupidity appears "hell bent" on "<a href="{{ asset('storage/assets/betrayalofthepromise.pdf') }}">betraying the
                    promise</a>" and in so doing will surely destroy South Africa. They are doing this
                    by following the clearly wrong strategy that was used by Bob Mugabe in Zimbabwe, which killed Zimbawe stone dead.  This "dumber than a rock" approach, and its latest evil looting machination, is shown in the image below.<br>
                    <img class="img-fluid" src="{{ asset('storage/images/stealland.png') }}" > <br>
                    The simple fact is that this nowhere short term pillaging mindset has plunged Zimbabwe into the morass and depths of economic despair and ruin, yet the "Absolutely No Clue" do not care as they grab what they can regardless of who they harm in the process! <br>
                    Anyone with half a brain cell, looking over the border, will see the clear empirical evidence and result, which apparently is totally lost on these morons!<br>
                    <br>
                    Obviously the governing party has "Absolutely No Clue" about Economics, <a href="/pmway/?slide=2">governance or how to create real wealth</a> and sadly George Orwell, with his Animal Farm Allegory will, once again, be proven 100% correct in his observations.&nbsp;
                    Communists are simply a gang of thugs in power with promises to
                    their betrayed people they have no, never had any, intentions of
                    keeping.<br>
                    <br>
                    If the last 2 and a half
                    decades are anything to go
                    by (<a href="/home/gamestats" >diminishing production
                    statistics</a> under the
                    misguided direction of the
                    ANC) we are sure to end up like
                    Zimbabwe before the end of
                    the 3rd decade!<br>
                    <br>
                    Here is
                    the truth that the
                    communists refuse to
                    appreciate:&nbsp; "You can
                    remain ignorant on economics, but the reality of economics will not ignore
                    you!"<br>
                    <br>
                    Sadly (for the common good of the
                    South African society), when there is a total lack of ethics, lack of education or understanding of the basics like economics, good governance etc., (and BBBEEcause of ANC / Communist ideological idiocy, caders are deployed into key positions where their goal is to mismanage and undermine the good governance of government entities for personal gain which is done with vigor and impunity (knowing that they will be never be prosecuted and will be protected due to ANC institutionalization of acceptance of crime without consequences and punishment)); the quote below sums up the problem: <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;Arguing with an idiot is like playing chess with a pigeon! <br>
                    It'll just knock over all the pieces, shit on the board, and strut about like it's won anyway." <br>

                      the ultimate realization of a gangster state. Undermining the dreams of the New South Africa,
                      the Rainbow Nation as

                      Set in Venezuela the

                      A quick glance over the border at the state of Zimbabwe, as empirical evidence of failed communist ideology, is surely enough to illustrate the clear and present danger
                      for South Africa as we look at the

<h3>Why the pigeons broke the Rainbow Nation?</h3>
<h5>And why they have to blame everyone else?</h5>
<br>

<p>If you <a href="/register">Register</a> and <a href="/register">Login</a> to
this page in PMWay then you will see how PMWay &quot;tech&quot; is applied to understand
and solve the total lack of governance&nbsp; (corruption / low / no production)
problem being experienced in the &quot;New South Africa.&quot;<br><br>
Understanding that those in charge have &quot;Absolutely No Clue&quot; and are operating
at
<a href="/pmway/?slide=4" >Capability Maturity Level ZERO</a> (and the reason why they need to blame every one else for their incompetence) is one of
the sanity checks that PMWay offers.&nbsp; PMWay also suggests that the section
on &quot;gas-lighting&quot; will help those of us who are struggling to understand what
happened to our (and Nelson Mandela's) vision of the &quot;Rainbow Nation,&quot; and how to
protect ourselves against &quot;them&quot; that &quot;broke it,&quot; but who
are upping the heat against us.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<div align="center">
<button class="btn btn-primary align-center clearfix" type="button" data-toggle=
"collapse" data-target="#collapseopinion" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls=
        "collapseopinion">Let's up the heat
</button>

<div class="collapse" id="collapseopinion">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="card text-center">
<h5 class="card-header" align="center">Because we want their stuff</h5>
            <div class="card-body text-center">
	<p align="center"><img alt="upping the heat" class="img-fluid" src="{{ asset('storage/images/rainbownation.jpg') }}"></p>

<br>
	<p>Another is to come to understand that their &quot;modus operandi&quot;
and &quot;unethical games and agenda,&quot; sadly, is exactly what one must expect
from the <a href="{{ asset('storage/assets/communism.pdf') }}" >Communist
mentality</a> which, to put it simply, wants to take for themselves what we have and
what we have built (because they are not Entrepreneurs and can't).&nbsp; This was clearly explained by George Orwell in his book &quot;<a href="{{ asset('storage/assets/animalfarm.pdf') }}" >Animal Farm</a>.&quot;&nbsp;
The other idea, that we are in fact dealing with pigeons with whom no logical
argument about the rules (of how to play chess or anything else) is possible, is also clearly explained.</p>

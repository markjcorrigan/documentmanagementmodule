Your error log points to corrupted InnoDB redo log files as the cause of the repeated startup failures. This is a specific but known issue that can be resolved by removing the problematic files.

The table below compares the primary and secondary solutions. The primary solution is simpler and often resolves the issue.

Method	Action	What It Does	Key Consideration
Primary Fix: Delete InnoDB Logs	Delete ib_logfile0 and ib_logfile1 from C:\xampp\mysql\data\.	Clears corrupted redo logs, allowing MySQL to generate fresh ones on restart.	Data is generally safe; your actual databases (table .ibd files) remain intact.
Secondary Fix: Replace Data Folder	Replace the entire data folder with a backup, then restore your custom databases.	Resets all system files to a clean state.	Requires a backup. If you don't have a clean data folder backup, this will delete your databases.
Step-by-Step Guide (Primary Fix)
Stop Services & Make a Backup:

Close the XAMPP Control Panel completely.

Navigate to C:\xampp\mysql\. Copy the entire data folder and save it elsewhere (e.g., your Desktop) as a safety backup.

Delete Corrupted Log Files:

Go to C:\xampp\mysql\data\.

Find and delete the two files ib_logfile0 and ib_logfile1.

Start MySQL:

Run XAMPP Control Panel as Administrator (right-click, select "Run as administrator"). This avoids permission issues.

Start the MySQL service. It should now regenerate clean log files and start successfully.

If the Primary Fix Doesn't Work
If MySQL still fails to start, the system tables in the data folder may also be corrupted. You can try the secondary method of replacing the entire data folder, but this requires a backup. In XAMPP, a clean data folder backup is located at C:\xampp\mysql\backup\.

If you've exhausted these options or are concerned about data loss, you can attempt a more advanced forced InnoDB recovery by adding innodb_force_recovery = 1 to the [mysqld] section of your my.ini file, then trying to start MySQL to dump your data.

NBNBNB>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Got it - if you don't need to recover any data and just want MySQL working again, you have two options:
Option 1: Quick Reset (Recommended if you don't need data)

Stop MySQL in XAMPP Control Panel
Rename or delete these folders:

C:\xampp\mysql\data


Copy the backup data folder:

Copy C:\xampp\mysql\backup to C:\xampp\mysql\data  I left pmway.hopto.org and joguitar.loginto.me in place and deleted everything else and then copied backup into the empty deleted folder (sans pmway and jobuitar)


Start MySQL

Option 2: Force Recovery (if Option 1 doesn't work)
Paste your my.ini file content here (from C:\xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini) and I'll add the recovery line for you.

To help you decide on the next step, could you confirm if you have a recent backup of your C:\xampp\mysql\data folder, or if your databases are critical and you cannot afford any data loss? This will help determine if you should proceed with the primary fix or explore data recovery methods first.

Excellent. You have a solid understanding of the situation. Knowing you have a backup fundamentally changes the strategy from "troubleshooting a crash" to "orchestrating a controlled recovery."

Here is a detailed guide on how to proceed when you have a backup, building on the information you've provided.

Critical Decision Point: State of Your Current data Folder
Before using your backup, you must decide on the goal:

Salvage Data First: You want to try recovering the newest possible data from the corrupted installation before overwriting it with the backup. This is the safer route if your backup is old.

Restore Backup Only: You want to get back to a clean, working state as quickly as possible, and the backup contains all the data you need (or data loss is acceptable).

I recommend following Path 1 unless you are certain the backup is very recent and complete.

Path 1: Salvage Data First, Then Restore (Recommended)
This is a two-phase process: first, try to start the corrupted server just long enough to dump your databases, then perform a clean restoration from your backup.

Phase A: Force Recovery & Export Data
Stop Everything: Ensure XAMPP's MySQL is stopped.

Locate Configuration File: Go to C:\xampp\mysql\bin\ and open the file my.ini in a text editor like Notepad (run as Administrator).

Enable Force Recovery: Find the [mysqld] section. Add this line:

ini
[mysqld]
innodb_force_recovery = 1
What this does: It starts MySQL in a crippled, read-only mode, bypassing certain corruption to allow data extraction.

Important: Start with level 1. If MySQL still won't start, increase the number to 2, then 3, etc., up to 6 (each level is more aggressive). Do not use levels 4, 5, or 6 for production databases without research, as they can cause data inconsistency.

Apply Primary Fix: Also, delete the corrupted log files (ib_logfile0 and ib_logfile1) as you described. This is often needed in conjunction with the force recovery setting.

Start MySQL: Run XAMPP Control Panel as Administrator and try to start MySQL.

Export Your Databases:

If MySQL starts, open http://localhost/phpmyadmin/.

For each of your custom databases (not information_schema, mysql, performance_schema, or phpmyadmin):

Select the database.

Go to the Export tab.

Choose method "Custom".

Set format to SQL.

Crucially, under "Output," choose "Save output to a file" and export it to a safe location (like your Desktop).

Alternative (Command Line): You can also use mysqldump from the command line if phpMyAdmin is inaccessible. Navigate to C:\xampp\mysql\bin\ and run:

bash
mysqldump -u root -p --databases YOUR_DATABASE_NAME > C:\Desktop\database_backup.sql
Stop MySQL: Once all critical data is exported, stop the MySQL service in XAMPP.

Phase B: Perform a Clean Restore from Backup
Now, you will replace the entire corrupted data folder with your known-good backup.

Prepare Your Backup: Locate your backup of the C:\xampp\mysql\data\ folder. Ensure it's ready.

Stop Services & Delete Corrupted Data:

Exit the XAMPP Control Panel.

Rename the current, corrupted C:\xampp\mysql\data\ folder to data_corrupted (as a final precaution).

Copy your backup data folder and paste it into C:\xampp\mysql\. It should now be at C:\xampp\mysql\data\.

Clean Start:

Remove the innodb_force_recovery line you added to my.ini and save the file. A clean backup should not need it.

Ensure the ib_logfile0 and ib_logfile1 from your backup are present. They will be valid for that backup.

Start MySQL: Run XAMPP as Administrator and start MySQL. It should start normally, returning you to the state of your backup.

Import Salvaged Data: If you exported new data in Phase A:

Open phpMyAdmin.

Select the target database.

Go to the Import tab.

Choose the SQL file you saved and execute it.

Path 2: Direct Restore from Backup (Simpler, Riskier)
Use this only if your backup is recent enough that losing all data added since then is acceptable.

Follow Phase B, Steps 1-4 from above exactly.

Stop XAMPP.

Rename the corrupted data folder.

Copy your backup data folder into place.

Ensure my.ini has no innodb_force_recovery setting.

Start MySQL as Administrator.

Your system is now restored to the exact state of the backup.

Summary & Final Checklist Before Acting
Your Scenario	Recommended Action
Backup exists, but is old. Data added since backup is critical.	Follow Path 1. Force recovery, dump data, clean restore, import new data.
Backup is recent and complete. No critical changes since backup.	Follow Path 2. Direct restore. It's faster and simpler.
No backup, or primary fix failed.	You must try the forced recovery method (innodb_force_recovery) as a last resort to dump data.
Before you begin:

Verified Backup: You have physically copied your backup to another location (e.g., Desktop) and can confirm its integrity.

XAMPP is Stopped: The control panel is fully closed.

Administrator Rights: You are prepared to run all tools (Notepad, XAMPP) as Administrator.

Exported Data Saved: If following Path 1, you know where you will save the SQL dump files.

You have a significant advantage by having a backup. The process is now about minimizing data loss rather than preventing total loss. Proceed methodically, and you will recover your system.

how do i upgrade to livewire 4 from livewire 3
Here's a step-by-step guide to upgrade from Livewire 3 to Livewire 4:

1. Update Dependencies
First, update your composer.json:

json
{
    "require": {
        "livewire/livewire": "^4.0",
        "livewire/volt": "^2.0" // if using Volt
    }
}
Then run:

bash
composer update livewire/livewire
2. Key Breaking Changes
Component Base Class
Livewire 4 uses Component instead of Component from a different namespace:

php
// Before (Livewire 3)
use Livewire\Component;

// After (Livewire 4) - SAME namespace
use Livewire\Component;
// The namespace remains the same, but check for method changes
Method Signature Changes
mount() method signature has changed slightly

Lifecycle hooks may have different signatures

Blade Directives
Update Blade directives:

blade
{{-- Livewire 3 --}}
@livewire('component-name')

{{-- Livewire 4 --}}
<livewire:component-name />
3. Update Configuration
Run the publish command:

bash
php artisan livewire:publish --config
Check your config/livewire.php for changes:

Updated asset URLs

4. Update Assets
Update Livewire's JavaScript assets:

bash
npm install @livewire/livewire@4
Or update your package.json:

json

    }
}

Action Methods

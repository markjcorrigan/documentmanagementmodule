Fix 1: Update PHP Settings
File: C:\xampp\php\php.ini

upload_max_filesize = 2048M
post_max_size = 2048M
max_execution_time = 600
max_input_time = 600
memory_limit = 512M


413 error means the server is blocking large uploads! This is a PHP/Apache configuration issue, not Laravel.
Since you're using XAMPP, you need to update these settings:
Fix 1: Update PHP Settings
File: C:\xampp\php\php.ini
Find and change these lines:
iniupload_max_filesize = 2048M
post_max_size = 2048M
max_execution_time = 600
max_input_time = 600
memory_limit = 512M
Fix 2: Update Apache Settings (if needed)
File: C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-default.conf
Add this line:
apacheLimitRequestBody 2147483648
Fix 3: Restart XAMPP
Stop and restart Apache in XAMPP Control Panel.
Fix 4: Update Laravel Validation
File: app/Http/Controllers/Admin/GuitarPieceController.php
Change line 38:
php'video' => 'required|file|mimes:mp4|max:2097152', // 2GB max (2048 MB * 1024)
And line 81:
php'video' => 'nullable|file|mimes:mp4|max:2097152', // 2GB max

After making these changes:

Restart XAMPP Apache
Clear Laravel cache: php artisan config:clear
Try uploading again

Note: Videos over 2GB should work, but I recommend keeping them under 1GB for faster loading on the frontend carousel. Let me know if it still fails!#
# This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/> for detailed information.
# In particular, see 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/directives.htmpastedwhere must fix 2. go10:03 AMPinpointed optimal Apache configuration section for directive placement.The user wants to know where to add the LimitRequestBody directive in the Apache config file. Looking at the file they provided, I can see it's the main httpd.conf file.
The LimitRequestBody directive should be added in a location where it applies to all requests. The best place would be:

Inside the main <Directory> block for the DocumentRoot
Or in the httpd-default.conf file which is included at the bottom

Since they're asking specifically about this file, I should tell them to add it in the <Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs"> section, which starts around line 246.
Actually, looking more carefully, the user is asking where "Fix 2" should go. Fix 2 was about adding LimitRequestBody 2147483648 to the Apache config.
The best place would be in the <Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs"> block or globally. Let me point them to the right location.Add Fix 2 in the <Directory> block for your document root.
Find this section (around line 246):
apacheDocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs"
<Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs">
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
</Directory>
Change it to:
apacheDocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs"
<Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs">
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
    LimitRequestBody 2147483648
</Directory>
That's it! Just add LimitRequestBody 2147483648 inside the <Directory> block.
Then:

Save the file
Restart Apache in XAMPP Control Panel
Try uploading again
